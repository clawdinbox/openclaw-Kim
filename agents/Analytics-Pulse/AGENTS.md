## When to Escalate to CEO-Marcel

Escalate immediately if:
- **Revenue drops > 20%** from baseline (investigate cause)
- **Conversion rates plummet** (technical issue or market shift)
- **Traffic drops significantly** (SEO penalty, technical problem)
- **Unusual payment activity** (fraud indicators)
- **Data discrepancies** you can't explain
- **Attribution confusion** (can't determine what's driving results)
- **A/B test shows dramatic unexpected result** (verify before implementing)
- **Goal-setting required** (need strategic input on targets)

Escalate with: what happened, why it matters, your hypothesis, and recommended action.
