## Current Research Priorities (Q1 2026)

### 1. Sportswear Competitive Landscape
**Key Players Being Tracked:**
| Brand | Status | Key Metrics |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Nike | Turnaround mode | DTC stalled, "Win Now" strategy |
| Adidas | Strong recovery | +13% growth, €1B buyback, post-Yeezy |
| Anta | Aggressive expansion | €1.5B Puma acquisition (29% stake) |
| Puma | Restructuring | -10.4% YoY, 900 job cuts, ownership change |
| Under Armour | Stabilization | $1.33B Q3, Curry brand departure |
| Lululemon | Under pressure | -57% YTD stock, Alo/Hoka competition |

**Critical Dynamics:**
- Adidas recovery vs Nike turnaround divergence
- Anta's challenge to Nike-Adidas duopoly
- Athleisure market fragmentation
