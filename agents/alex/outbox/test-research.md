## 3. IMPLICATIONS

### For Nike
• **Valuation pressure:** Trading at 3.4x Adidas market cap despite competitive headwinds suggests either Nike overvaluation or Adidas undervaluation
• **China vulnerability:** Anta's domestic dominance (23% share) combined with Puma's global infrastructure creates a dual-threat competitor
• **Turnaround urgency:** DTC stall + Converse weakness = need for near-term proof points before Q3 earnings

### For Adidas
• **Recovery validation:** Stock remains ~42% below 52-week highs despite operational recovery — potential value gap if momentum continues
• **Competitive encirclement:** Anta-Puma combination pressures Adidas' European home market and China growth ambitions simultaneously
• **World Cup leverage:** 2026 FIFA World Cup timing aligns with recovery narrative — execution critical

### For the Sportswear Landscape
• **Tripolar structure emerging:** Nike (scale), Adidas (recovery), Anta-Puma (consolidation challenger) — duopoly becoming oligopoly
• **Chinese expansion accelerates:** Anta's move follows Shein/Temu playbook — use capital to acquire Western brands/infrastructure
• **Consolidation signal:** $1.8B transaction suggests further M&A likely as mid-tier brands struggle (Puma restructuring precedent)
