## 5. Strategic Positioning Recommendations

### Do's (Aligned with Marcel's Direction)

✅ **Price at €19-€49** — accessible to individual professionals  
✅ **Focus on "how-to" and frameworks** — actionable over theoretical  
✅ **Target solopreneurs, consultants, small brand owners** — not enterprises  
✅ **Position as complementary** to Heuritech/Luxurynsight data  
✅ **Create "instant win" products** — immediate value, not long courses  
✅ **Use accessible language** — "guide" and "playbook" over "masterclass"  

### Don'ts (Avoiding WGSN/EDITED Territory)

❌ **Avoid €99+ pricing** — signals institutional/enterprise  
❌ **Don't compete with data SaaS** — that's Heuritech/Luxurynsight's domain  
❌ **Avoid "trend forecasting reports"** — that's what subscriptions provide  
❌ **Don't position as "training"** — workshops/courses feel expensive  
❌ **Avoid "certification" language** — increases production complexity  

### The Winning Positioning Formula

```
[Specific Problem] + [Actionable Solution] + [Immediate Application] = €19-€49

Example:
"The Independent Buyer's Sourcing Playbook"
→ Not "trend forecasting" (SaaS territory)
→ Not "how to be a buyer" (generic)
→ But: "The exact framework I use to source products 40% faster"
```
