## 1. LVMH Q4 2025: The Luxury Bellwether Stumbles

**THESIS:** LVMH's 8% share price drop signals that luxury sector recovery remains fragile, with China rebound underwhelming and core fashion/leather goods margins compressing.

**DATA:**
- Q4 2025 organic sales: €22.7 billion (+1% YoY) — missed heightened analyst expectations (per LVMH earnings release, January 2026)
- Full-year 2025 revenue: €80.8 billion (down 5% YoY, per S&P Global)
- Fashion and leather goods operating profit: **down 13%** in Q4 — the division accounts for >50% of group profits
- Share price decline: **~7-8%** following results, with ripple effects across sector (Kering -5%, Moncler -4%, Hermès -2%)
- Watches and jewelry: rare bright spot with +8% organic sales (Tiffany & Co.)
- Wine and spirits: cognac sales declining in China and US

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- Bernard Arnault explicitly signaled cost preservation over expansion for 2026: "2026 won't be simple"
- China recovery narrative overstated — LVMH's rebound described as "underwhelming" vs. more optimistic commentary from Richemont/Burberry
- US tariffs + weak dollar compressing margins across the group
- CFO Cécile Cabanis: "We need growth... and we are going to focus on getting growth going again"

**SOURCES:**
- LVMH Q4 2025 earnings call transcript, January 2026
- S&P Global Market Intelligence, February 2026
- ArtNews, "LVMH Shares Tank by 8% as Luxury Sector Struggles to Recover"

**COUNTER-EVIDENCE:** Watches/jewelry (+8%) and selective strength in beauty suggest category rotation, not universal luxury collapse.

## 2. Saks Global Chapter 11: The Department Store Model Cracks

**THESIS:** Saks Global's bankruptcy filing exposes the structural fragility of luxury department store consolidation — the 2024 Neiman Marcus acquisition created a debt trap, not synergies.

**DATA:**
- **Filed:** January 14, 2026, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Southern District of Texas
- **Debtor-in-possession financing:** $1.75 billion ($1.5B from senior secured bondholders + $240M from asset-based lenders)
- **Store closures:** 57 Saks OFF 5TH locations, all remaining Last Call stores — only 12 OFF 5TH stores will remain (as liquidation channels)
- **Leadership change:** CEO Richard Baker stepped down January 13; replaced by Geoffroy van Raemdonck (former Neiman Marcus CEO)
- **Amazon partnership ending:** Saks on Amazon storefront (launched late 2024) being unwound per January 30 reports
- **Creditor committee includes:** Amazon, Chanel, LVMH, Brookfield Properties Retail — the major luxury brands have leverage over restructuring

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- The 2024 Neiman Marcus acquisition loaded Saks with unsustainable debt just as luxury demand softened
- Off-price model (OFF 5TH) being abandoned — signals retreat from discount channel, potentially protecting full-price brand equity
- Luxury brands (Chanel, LVMH) now effectively control Saks' fate — could "suffocate" the retailer if they stop shipping (per Reuters/BoF)
- Amazon partnership unwind suggests Saks is retreating from digital wholesale, focusing on owned channels

**SOURCES:**
- The Fashion Law, "Saks Global's Chapter 11: A Running Timeline"
- Business of Fashion, January 2026
- Saks Global Chapter 11 court filings, January 2026

**COUNTER-EVIDENCE:** $1.75B DIP financing and continued operations suggest restructuring, not liquidation — stores remain open, vendor payments continuing.

## 3. Columbia Sportswear Q4 2025: Margin Discipline Wins

**THESIS:** Columbia Sportswear delivered an earnings beat through operational excellence — expanding margins despite revenue headwinds and $20M in tariff costs, proving the ACCELERATE strategy is working.

**DATA:**
- **Q4 2025 net sales:** $1,070.2 million (down 2% YoY, but beat analyst forecasts)
- **Gross margin:** 51.6% (up 50 basis points YoY) — new highs
- **Operating income:** $116.7 million (10.9% operating margin)
- **Tariff impact:** $20M in Q4, $31M for full year 2025 — successfully mitigated through sourcing shifts and pricing
- **Cash position:** $790.8 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments; **zero debt**
- **Full-year 2025:** $3,397.4M net sales (+1% YoY), gross margin 50.5% (+30 bps)
- **2026 guidance:** Net sales $3.43B-$3.50B (+1-3% growth), operating margin 6.2%-6.9%

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- International markets driving momentum — CEO Tim Boyle highlighted "strong international performance" as ACCELERATE strategy gains traction
- "Engineered for Whatever" campaign differentiating brand in crowded outdoor/active market
- Wholesale partners expanding orders for new product collections (footwear lines, innovative apparel)
- Impairment charges for prAna and Mountain Hardwear ($29M) reflect portfolio discipline — cutting underperformers

**SOURCES:**
- Columbia Sportswear Company Q4 2025 earnings release, February 3, 2026
- AlphaStreet News, "Columbia Q4 2025 Earnings Pop: Profit Margins Hit New Highs"
- Seeking Alpha earnings call transcript, February 3, 2026

**COUNTER-EVIDENCE:** Q1 2026 guidance shows expected sales decline of 2.5-4% — suggests continued North American softness even as international grows.

- **Running market context:** Per Circana, running shoe dollar sales up 9% in Q4 2025

**IMPLICATIONS:** Running category continues to dominate performance footwear — HOKA (Deckers) +18.5% to $628.9M in Q3, Brooks +16% full year. The "running lifestyle" trend shows no signs of slowing.
