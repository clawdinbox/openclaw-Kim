## Story 1: Kering's Radical Restructuring Under Luca de Meo — The Luxury Turnaround to Watch

**THESIS:** Luca de Meo is executing the most aggressive restructuring in Kering's recent history—slashing costs, closing stores, and selling assets—to engineer a return to growth in 2026, with markets already pricing in optimism despite a €29M net loss.

**DATA:**
• **Q4 2025 comparable sales:** Down 3% to €3.91B (beat consensus estimate of -5% to €3.83B) — per Kering earnings, Feb 10, 2026
• **Full year 2025 revenue:** €14.7B, down 10% YoY — per Kering earnings
• **Net loss 2025:** €29M vs. net profit of €1.02B in 2024 — per WWD, Feb 10, 2026
• **Recurring operating profit:** Down 33% to €1.63B; operating margin fell from 14.5% to 11.1%
• **Gucci performance:** Q4 comparable sales down 10% (vs. -11% consensus), still 59% of group operating profit
• **Cost savings delivered:** €925M in 2025, reducing operating expenses 9% YoY — per de Meo
• **Store closures:** 75 completed in 2025, 100 more planned for 2026
• **Net debt reduction:** Down to €8.04B from €10.5B (includes sale of Kering Beauté to L'Oréal for ~€4B)
• **Stock reaction:** Shares jumped 12-14% on earnings day (Feb 10), though still down 14% YTD
• **Other brands Q4:** Saint Laurent flat, Balenciaga/McQueen group up 3%, Bottega Veneta up 3%

**IMPLICATIONS:**
• De Meo is moving faster than expected—cost cuts are deeper, balance sheet repair is accelerating
• Gucci's stabilization (even at -10%) is a positive signal with Demna's first collection now in market
• Capital Markets Day on April 16 in Florence will be critical—market wants to see the full roadmap
• Kering's recovery could signal broader luxury sector stabilization if execution holds

**WHAT TO WATCH:**
• Gucci Q1 2026 numbers—first real test of Demna + de Meo combination
• China recovery trajectory—luxury demand there remains weak but stabilizing
• Margin expansion—can they rebuild from 11.1% toward historic 20%+ levels?

## Story 2: Under Armour's "Bottom of the Reset" — Plank's Turnaround Shows Early Green Shoots

**THESIS:** Kevin Plank has engineered a profitability surprise despite revenue decline, signaling the restructuring phase may be ending and setting up Under Armour for a potential 2026 inflection if brand momentum sustains.

**DATA:**
• **Q3 FY2026 revenue:** $1.33B, down 5% YoY but beating consensus estimate of $1.31B (-6.3%) — per Business of Fashion, Feb 6, 2026
• **Adjusted EPS:** $0.09 vs. consensus estimate of -$0.02 loss — 11c beat
• **FY2026 EPS guidance raised:** To $0.10-0.11 from prior $0.03-0.05 (233-220% increase at midpoint)
• **Revenue guidance:** Now expects -4% vs. prior -4% to -5%
• **Restructuring charges:** $224M incurred under "Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan" — per Finterra, Feb 6, 2026
• **SKU reduction:** 25% of product lines cut to focus on higher-priced training, running, team sports
• **Gross margin:** Down 310 bps to 44.4% (tariff impacts), but expected to stabilize
• **Tariff headwinds:** ~$100M expected cost impact this fiscal year from Vietnam/Indonesia tariffs
• **Stock reaction:** Up 13%+ on earnings day following results
• **Plank quote:** "North America is beginning to turn the corner. We believe the December quarter marks the bottom of the reset."

**IMPLICATIONS:**
• Plank's cost discipline is working—earnings quality improving even as top-line struggles
• SKU rationalization (25% cut) is a bold move—risky short-term, necessary for brand elevation
• Tariff exposure ($100M) is a significant margin headwind that competitors also face
• Curry Brand spinoff and "bolder storytelling" focus suggest brand-led recovery strategy
• Fairfax Financial's 22% stake provides financial backing and potential strategic options

**WHAT TO WATCH:**
• Q4 results (March)—confirmation that December was indeed "the bottom"
• North America fall order book trends—management called them "encouraging"
• Footwear recovery—down 14% YTD, critical for brand heat
• New product launches in training/running—key to higher-price strategy

## Story 3: VF Corp's Portfolio Divergence — The North Face/Timberland Strength vs. Vans Drag

**THESIS:** VF Corp is executing a tale of two portfolios—The North Face and Timberland accelerating with 5% growth each, while Vans continues to drag with 10% decline, creating a complex turnaround dynamic under CEO Bracken Darrell.

**DATA:**
• **Q4 2025 revenue:** $2.82B vs. $2.75B consensus (+4.4% YoY, +2.5% beat) — per IndexBox, Feb 4, 2026
• **Adjusted EPS:** $0.56 vs. $0.44 consensus (+26.4% beat)
• **Adjusted EBITDA:** $426.6M vs. $369.2M estimate (+15.5% beat, 15.1% margin)
• **Operating margin:** 10.2% vs. 8.4% same quarter prior year
• **The North Face revenue:** Up 5% (new product launches, DTC strength)
• **Timberland revenue:** Up 5% (new product launches)
• **Vans revenue:** Down 10% (ongoing softness, though "green shoots" noted)
• **Q1 2026 guidance:** $2.02B midpoint vs. $2.08B consensus (below expectations)
• **Market cap:** $8.18B — per IndexBox

**IMPLICATIONS:**
• VF Corp's diversification is providing stability—two strong brands offsetting Vans weakness
• DTC focus paying off for The North Face—suggests playbook that could work for Vans eventually
• Tariff headwinds mentioned as ongoing challenge—affects sourcing from Bangladesh, Vietnam
• Management cautious on full-year guidance—predictability needed before returning to annual outlooks
• Store traffic remains down for Vans (per CEO on call), digital traffic up—channel shift ongoing

**WHAT TO WATCH:**
• Vans recovery pace—analysts focused on store traffic and new product reception
• The North Face momentum sustainability in Americas—key growth driver
• Tariff mitigation strategies—pricing and sourcing levers being pulled
• Potential strategic moves—will VF consider portfolio actions if Vans doesn't turn?

## BONUS: Columbia Sportswear's "ACCELERATE" Momentum

**Quick Take:** Columbia beat Q4 guidance with "Engineered for Whatever" campaign showing early traction. Revenue down 2% to $1.07B (better than feared), international growth offsetting US weakness. FY2025 sales up 1% to $3.4B. CEO Tim Boyle's ACCELERATE strategy targeting younger consumers appears to be gaining initial traction.

**Key Data:**
• Q4 2025: $1,070.2M (-2% YoY, -3% constant currency), beat guidance
• FY2025: $3.4B (+1% YoY)
• Gross margin: 51.6% (+50 bps YoY)
• FY2026 EPS guidance: $3.20-3.65 (vs. $3.23 in 2025)

**CROSS-CUTTING THEMES:**

1. **Turnaround Season:** Three major sportswear/luxury players (Kering, Under Armour, VF Corp) are simultaneously executing restructuring—cost cuts, portfolio moves, brand resets. Market rewarding execution (all stocks up on earnings), but patience required for revenue recovery.

2. **Tariff Headwinds:** Under Armour quantified $100M impact; VF Corp and Columbia also citing pressure. Bangladesh tariff reduction to 19% (from 20%) could benefit VF Corp specifically.

3. **Portfolio Divergence:** Winners (The North Face, Timberland) vs. strugglers (Vans, Gucci) creating complex narratives. Multi-brand groups seeing internal dispersion.

4. **SKU Rationalization:** Both Under Armour (25% cut) and Kering (streamlined offerings) pursuing product line simplification—industry-wide focus on fewer, better products.

**END OF BRIEF**
