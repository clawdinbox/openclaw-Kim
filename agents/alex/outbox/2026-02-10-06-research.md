## Story 1: Adidas Reports Record 2025 Revenue (+4.7%) and 54% Operating Profit Jump

**THESIS:** Adidas has completed its turnaround under Bjørn Gulden, delivering record revenue and a dramatic profitability expansion that signals the brand has regained pricing power and operational discipline.

**DATA:**
- Net sales: €24.81 billion (+4.7% year-over-year) — all-time record per preliminary results (Marca, Feb 3, 2026)
- Operating profit: €2.056 billion (+54% YoY) — increase of over €700 million from 2024
- Operating margin: 8.3% (vs. 5.6% in 2024)
- Q4 2025 revenue: €6.076 billion (+11% at constant exchange rates)
- Q4 operating profit: €164 million (more than doubled YoY)
- Gross margin Q4: 50.8% (+100 basis points)
- Full-year gross margin: 51.6% (highlighting "quality of growth" per Gulden)
- **Capital return:** Board approved €1 billion share buyback program for 2026

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- The Samba/Gazelle terrace shoe phenomenon has successfully diversified Adidas beyond performance into lifestyle — a segment where margins are structurally higher
- €1B buyback signals management confidence in cash generation sustainability, not just one-off recovery
- Operating margin expansion of 270 basis points demonstrates pricing power recovery after years of discounting
- Nike faces a genuinely resurgent competitor in Europe and key lifestyle segments

## Story 2: LVMH FY2025 Results Confirm Luxury Sector Headwinds — Revenue Down 5%, Profit Down 9%

**THESIS:** The world's largest luxury group has posted its weakest full-year results in recent memory, confirming that the post-pandemic luxury boom has definitively ended and the sector faces a structural demand reset, particularly in China.

**DATA:**
- Full-year 2025 revenue: €80.8 billion (-5% reported, -1% organic growth)
- Operating profit: €17.8 billion (-9% YoY)
- First-half 2025: Revenue down 4%, profits plunged 22%
- Full-year results "modestly beat expectations" but 2026 outlook revised downward (S&P Global, Feb 4, 2026)
- Stock has stabilized around €529-533 but momentum remains weak
- Champagne unit settled bonus dispute with workers (Traders Union, Feb 5, 2026)

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- The China-driven luxury supercycle is over; middle-class aspirational buyers have pulled back dramatically
- LVMH's resilience relative to peers (Richemont, Kering) will depend on ultra-high-net-worth concentration
- 2026 guidance cuts suggest management sees sustained weakness, not a V-shaped recovery
- Margins under pressure despite pricing power — a warning signal for sector profitability
- Counter-evidence: Results still "beat expectations" showing analysts had priced in even worse performance

**SOURCES:**
- S&P Global Market Intelligence, Feb 4, 2026 — lvmh-post-earnings-review-2025-results-beat-forecast-2026-outlook-cloudier
- Traders Union, Feb 5, 2026 — LVMH stock stabilizes above €529

## Story 3: Kering Sells Beauty Division to L'Oréal for €4 Billion + Forms Luxury/Wellness Joint Venture

**THESIS:** Kering's €4 billion divestment of its beauty division (including Creed) to L'Oréal is the first major strategic move under new CEO Luca de Meo to reduce Gucci-dependency, while the accompanying joint venture signals a bet on "luxury wellness" as the next frontier for high-margin growth.

**DATA:**
- Transaction value: €4 billion ($4.7 billion) for Kering's beauty division
- Brands included: Creed fragrance house plus beauty licenses for Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga
- Announced: October 2025
- **Joint venture component:** Creation of JV to explore opportunities "at the intersection of luxury, wellness and longevity" (Korea Times, Feb 4, 2026)
- L'Oréal brings: 15 years of skin/scalp aging research, biological age diagnostic tools, LED beauty devices, increased Galderma (injectable fillers) investment
- Kering brings: High-net-worth customer access, luxury retail locations, event expertise
- Context: Global wellness market was $2 trillion in 2024, projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2028 (McKinsey/BoF)
- 84% of U.S. consumers and 94% of Chinese consumers prioritizing wellness (McKinsey)

**IMPLICATIONS:**
- De Meo is executing a portfolio rationalization to focus Kering on core fashion/leather goods where it has competitive advantage
- The JV structure preserves upside for Kering in beauty/wellness without operational burden
- "Longevity luxury" represents a nascent category — medically-backed wellness programs for the ultra-wealthy
- Risk: Medical/wellness services carry higher brand risk than fragrance; execution must be "impeccable" per analysts
- Competitive response: LVMH's Dior already operates ~10 spas; Celine launched $3,000 leather-covered kettlebell pilates collection; Golden Goose opened Padel arena in Milan

**SOURCES:**
- Wikipedia Kering entry citing Oct 2025 transaction
- Korea Times, Feb 4, 2026 — "Gucci's owner wants to help you age beautifully"
- Ideal Investisseur (France), Feb 5, 2026

## Cross-Cutting Themes

1. **Operational discipline beats growth narratives:** Adidas and Under Armour both delivered margin expansion through SKU rationalization and cost discipline; LVMH's revenue decline still generated substantial profits (€17.8B operating profit)

2. **The China question:** LVMH's weakness confirms China demand reset; Adidas's international growth signals strength in other markets; wellness-focused JV plays to Chinese consumer priorities (94% wellness prioritization)

3. **Category blurring:** Kering/L'Oréal JV represents luxury's move into wellness/services — a higher-frequency, higher-margin adjacent category
