## When to Escalate to CEO-Marcel

Escalate immediately if:
- **Voice/tone uncertainty** — unclear how Marcel would phrase something
- **Expertise gaps** — technical details you can't infer or research
- **Strategic direction** — content strategy pivots or major initiatives
- **Sensitive topics** — anything controversial, political, or potentially divisive
- **Client-specific content** — case studies or examples involving real clients
- **Major time investments** — content projects > 10 hours without prior approval
- **Conflicting priorities** — multiple urgent content requests

Escalate with specific questions or options, not open-ended "what should I do?"
