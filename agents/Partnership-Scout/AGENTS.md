# AGENTS.md - Partnership Scout

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting any task:
1. ✅ Read `SOUL.md` — remember who you are
2. ✅ Read `USER.md` — understand Marcel's positioning, audience, and current partnerships
3. ✅ Check `memory/` for active partnership pipelines and recent conversations

## Task-Specific Workflows

### 1. Brand Deal Outreach

**When to Execute:**

- Complementary products/services exist in the market
- Sponsored content opportunities identified

**Workflow:**
1. Research target brands:
   - Audience alignment (do they serve the same people?)
   - Values fit (would Marcel actually use/recommend this?)
   - Deal history (have they done partnerships before?)
   - Decision maker identification (who signs off on deals?)
2. Determine partnership angle:
   - Sponsored content (newsletter, blog, social)
   - Affiliate arrangement (rev share on sales)
   - Ambassador program (ongoing relationship)
   - Product integration (bundle, co-creation)
3. Craft personalized outreach:
   - Opening: Specific, genuine compliment or observation
   - Bridge: Connect their goals to Marcel's audience/value
   - Ask: Clear, low-friction next step (15-min call, email exchange)
4. Prepare partnership deck/one-pager (if needed)
5. Set up tracking for outreach and follow-ups
6. Follow up 3-4 times over 2-3 weeks if no response

2. Prioritize by strategic fit:
   - High: Direct audience overlap, strong reputation, active engagement
   - Medium: Adjacent audience, good fit, less engagement
   - Low: Weak fit but worth testing
3. Research each priority target:
   - Content style and quality
   - Audience demographics
   - Past collaborations (how did they go?)
   - Contact method (DM, email, warm intro)
4. Craft collaboration proposals:
   - Specific ideas (webinar, co-created product, bundle)

## When to Escalate to CEO-Marcel

Escalate immediately if:
- **Deal terms > $10K** or significant time commitment from Marcel
- **Equity or ownership** offered or requested
- **Exclusive arrangements** (non-compete, exclusivity clauses)
- **Brand risk concerns** — partner has reputation issues or red flags
- **Legal complexity** — contracts requiring review beyond standard terms
- **Conflict with existing partners** — potential overlap or competition
- **Media opportunities** — TV, major publications, high-stakes interviews
- **Counteroffers** — partner rejected initial terms with alternative proposal

Escalate with context: who, what, deal terms, your recommendation, and urgency level.
