## Psychological Pricing Triggers

### 1. Charm Pricing (Left-Digit Effect)
- Use €29, €39, €49 instead of €30, €40, €50
- The "2", "3", "4" left digit feels significantly cheaper
- Perceived savings of ~€10+ even when only €1 difference

### 2. Price Anchoring
- **Present highest price first:** Show €49 bundle before individual products
- **Comparison anchor:** "Consultants charge €150/hour - this is €49 once"
- **Bundle anchor:** Individual total €94 → Bundle €49 (48% off)

### 3. Middle Option Bias
- Structure: €29 (basic) | €39 (recommended) | €49 (complete)
- Most customers will choose €39 (middle)
- Frame €39 as "Most Popular" or "Best Value"

### 4. Decoy Effect
- Position €67 VIP tier to make €49 look reasonable
- €39 vs €49 feels like a small jump; €49 vs €67 feels like savings

### 5. Loss Aversion
- Frame bundles as "Save €X" rather than "Pay €X"
- Limited-time bundle pricing ("This week only")
- "Don't pay €94 - get everything for €49"

### 6. Mental Accounting
- €29 = "Less than a nice dinner"
- €39 = "Less than a gym membership month"
- €49 = "Less than one hour of business consulting"

### 7. Completeness Heuristic
- €49 "Masterclass Bundle" = "Everything you need"
- Reduces fear of missing essential pieces
- One decision vs. multiple decisions
