### Email 2: Value + Education (Day 2)
**Subject:** "The metric that predicts sportswear success"

```
Hi [First Name],

Most sportswear brands track the wrong metrics.

They obsess over:
❌ Social media followers
❌ Total revenue (without context)
❌ Generic "market share" numbers

But after analyzing 50+ brands for the report, 
one metric stands out as the real predictor:

→ **Repeat purchase rate within 90 days**

Here's why it matters:
- Costs 5x less than acquiring new customers
- Indicates product-market fit
- Predicts lifetime value better than any survey

The full report shows you:
- Industry benchmarks for this metric
- Which brands are crushing it (and why)
- 3 tactics to improve your rate

Tomorrow: The "Athleisure 2.0" trend decoded.

### Email 3: Case Study + Proof (Day 4)
**Subject:** "How [Brand X] grew 340% using this insight"

```
Hi [First Name],

Real talk: This email contains one insight from the report 
that could change how you think about sportswear marketing.

**THE INSIGHT:**
The brands winning in 2026 aren't competing on features.
They're competing on *identity alignment*.

**THE CASE STUDY:**
One mid-tier brand (name in the report) pivoted their 
messaging from "performance" to "everyday athlete identity."

Result? 340% growth in 18 months.

Why it worked:
✓ They stopped competing with Nike on tech specs
✓ They owned a specific identity niche
✓ They built community, not just customers

The full report breaks down:
→ The exact positioning shift they made
→ Their new messaging framework
→ How to apply this to your brand
