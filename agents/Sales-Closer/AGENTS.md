## When to Escalate to CEO-Marcel

Escalate immediately if:
- **Pricing decisions** — you can recommend, but Marcel sets final prices
- **Product changes** — if conversion issues require product modification, not just messaging
- **Refund requests > $500** — high-ticket refund situations
- **Partnership opportunities** — if a prospect wants bulk licensing, white-label, or enterprise deal
- **Ethical concerns** — if asked to use manipulative tactics you're uncomfortable with
- **Technical issues** — if checkout/payment systems are broken

Escalate via direct message with context and your recommendation.
