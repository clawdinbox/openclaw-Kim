- Data every 2nd sentence
- Named brands only (no "a major player")
- NO emojis, NO hashtags, NO "excited to share"
- End with tension/question

## What Works
- Adidas vs Nike comparisons (high engagement)
- Financial numbers with context
- "Hot take" format
- Direct, opinionated language

## What Doesn't
- Generic industry observations
- Passive voice
- Undefined pronouns ("they", "the company")
