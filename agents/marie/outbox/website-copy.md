## 2. ABOUT SECTION

### Who I Am
I am Marcel Melzig. I have spent 15+ years analyzing how fashion, luxury, and sportswear brands compete, win, and lose.

I have partnered with LIGANOVA and Luxurynsight to deliver competitive intelligence to executives at leading brands and investment firms.

### What I Do
I build executive briefings that cut through noise. I map market opportunities before they become obvious. I track what competitors are doing, why they are doing it, and what happens next.

My work combines financial analysis, brand positioning research, and market signal detection. I do not summarize news. I identify what matters.

### Why It Matters
Fashion and luxury markets reward early movers. A six-month head start on a trend or a competitor shift can mean the difference between leading and following.

I help executives make data-driven decisions with confidence. No guesswork. No hype. Just clear analysis of what is actually happening.
