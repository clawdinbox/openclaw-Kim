Nike is not invincible. And Adidas is not dead.

Both assumptions will cost you money in 2026.

I just published the Sportswear Competitive Intelligence Q1 2026 report. Six brands dissected: Nike, Adidas, Anta, Puma, Under Armour, Lululemon.

Three findings that contradict the consensus:

1. Adidas brand heat is recovering faster than the stock price suggests. Google search volume for "Adidas Samba" now exceeds pre-2015 levels. The problem is margin compression in North America, not brand relevance.

2. Nike's DTC push is hitting a wall. Retailers report 22% inventory growth without matching sell-through. The "Consumer Direct Acceleration" narrative is masking channel stress.

3. Anta just acquired 75% of Puma. This is not a side story. That deal closed at a €1.5 billion valuation that implies Puma trades at 60% of enterprise value to peers. Watch the integration execution.

The full deck is free on Gumroad. No email wall, no gate. Download it, fact-check me, tell me where I am wrong.

If you care about competitive positioning in sportswear, this is required reading.
