## Morning Session (06:00-07:15)

### Mission Control Fixes
- Fixed cron delivery targets for Daily X Post and Daily Substack Note (added Telegram chat ID)
- Disabled hourly Telegram updates (user: "not necessary")
- Paused X/Threads cron jobs temporarily, then re-enabled with new logic

### Postiz Workflow Change
- Deleted weekend posts (Feb 13-15) from Postiz - 7 posts total
- New approach: Daily cron checks Postiz first, skips if posts exist, researches fresh news if empty
- X: 08:00 daily | Threads: 07:00 daily
- Reason: Fresh news > batched stale content

### Security Scan
- OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.9
- System status: FileVault ON, Firewall ON, SSH off, User admin
- Time Machine: No destination configured (needs external SSD)
- OpenClaw audit: 0 critical, 1 warn (trusted proxies - irrelevant for local setup)

- Limitation discovered: API is read-only for products (no create/upload)
- Cannot create products or upload files via API

### Gumroad Upload Attempt
- Tried Browser Relay Chrome extension — blocked by CDP conflicts
- Tried OpenClaw built-in browser tool — Chrome extension relay blocking
- Attempted agent-browser-stagehand skill — installation incomplete (no code)
- Deleted defective skill
- Decision: Manual upload with prepared materials

### New Skills Tested
| Skill | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|

- Jobs executing successfully (News Monitor ran 3x at 12:00, 12:03, 12:21)
- Management interface (list, update) not responding
- Browser automation blocked due to missing Chrome Extension

### Attempted Fixes

**Structure:**
```
Marcel (CEO) → Kim (CSO/COO/CMO/CFO/etc) → 80 Sub-Agents
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
 Night Shift    Morning Shift   Evening Shift
 (00:00-08:00)  (08:00-16:00)   (16:00-00:00)
   25 Agents       25 Agents       25 Agents
```

**5 Business Squads (per shift):**
- Content Squad (social, trends, newsletters)
- Sales Squad (Gumroad, leads, emails)
- Research Squad (intel, reports, data)
- Partnership Squad (outreach, growth)
- Product Squad (ideation, frameworks)

**Cost-Optimized Model Stack:**
| Role | Model | Cost |
|------|-------|------|
| Marcel (CEO) | kimi-k2.5 Cloud | ~$10/day |

- Research: 100 sub-agents parallel, 1,500+ tool calls
- Benefit: 4.5x faster than sequential execution
- Organizational structure with self-designing hierarchy

### Role Clarity Established (15:35)
**Marcel (CEO):** Vision, strategy, final decisions
**Kim (CSO/COO/CMO/CFO/CTO):** Strategy, operations, marketing, finance, tech — all execution functions
**Sub-Agents:** Report to Kim, who reports to Marcel

### Research Knowledge Base (15:00-15:45)
**Completed Research Projects:**
1. Alex Finn Profile — "Henry" setup, Vibe Coding Academy, $60/month cost
2. Setup Comparison — Our system more sophisticated (17 agents), Finn's more autonomous
3. Kimi Agent Swarm — 100 agents parallel, 4.5x speed improvement
