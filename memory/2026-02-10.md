## Morning Session (06:00-07:15)

### Mission Control Fixes
- Fixed cron delivery targets for Daily X Post and Daily Substack Note (added Telegram chat ID)
- Disabled hourly Telegram updates (user: "not necessary")
- Paused X/Threads cron jobs temporarily, then re-enabled with new logic

### Postiz Workflow Change
- Deleted weekend posts (Feb 13-15) from Postiz - 7 posts total
- New approach: Daily cron checks Postiz first, skips if posts exist, researches fresh news if empty
- X: 08:00 daily | Threads: 07:00 daily
- Reason: Fresh news > batched stale content

### Security Scan
- OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.9
- System status: FileVault ON, Firewall ON, SSH off, User admin
- Time Machine: No destination configured (needs external SSD)
- OpenClaw audit: 0 critical, 1 warn (trusted proxies - irrelevant for local setup)

- Navigated to Gumroad dashboard
- Created new product with correct name, pricing, description
- Product is now publicly accessible with custom URL
- User completed manual file uploads (PDF, Cover, Thumbnail)

### Automation Tools Created

### Afternoon Report Delivered (14:00)
Topic: **The mid-market squeeze migration** — structural pressure hitting premium brands
- UK mid-market: 20.5% (2019) → 18.4% (2025)
- Mass market gained +3.6pp
- Full report: `documents/concepts/2026-02-10-mid-market-squeeze-premium.md`

### Browser Automation Learnings
- `openclaw` profile works without Chrome Extension
- CLI: `openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw open <url>`
- Can navigate, click, type
- File uploads require manual intervention (security restriction)
- Future workflow: Hybrid (automated navigation + manual file upload)

### Postiz API Integration Established (14:15)

### Social Media Content Rules — UPDATED
**Daily Posting Schedule (X & Threads):**
- 3 allgemeine Posts (breitere Themen)
- 2 Produkt-Posts (digitale Produkte bewerben)
- Total: 5 Posts/Tag pro Plattform

**Critical Workflow Change:**
- ALWAYS check existing Postiz schedule BEFORE creating content
- Today's mistake: Created duplicate content for posts already scheduled
- Deleted 3 duplicate QUEUE posts to clean up
- Result: ~10 QUEUE posts remain for today (various topics)

**Going Forward:**
- Do NOT create content proactively
- Wait for user request + check API first
- For Friday+: Create content Friday morning with fresh news
- Cron jobs (Daily X/Threads Post) run automatically 3x/day
