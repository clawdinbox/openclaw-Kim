## Key Events

### Opus 4.6 Upgrade & Cron Rewrite
- Switched model to Claude Opus 4.6
- Rewrote ALL cron job prompts for deeper, more structured output:
  - **Morning Brief** (08:00 daily, `d90b169b`) — tighter, ONE key signal, markets with % moves
  - **Afternoon Deep-Dive** (14:00 daily, `3950b848`) — analyst-grade, thesis/contrarian/actionable, saves to `documents/concepts/`
  - **Overnight Autonomous Projects** (20:00 daily, `72c0e629`) — renamed from "Proactive Coder", ships one substantial deliverable per night, 40min timeout
  - **LinkedIn Content Pipeline** (09:00 Mon/Wed/Fri, `880cd26b`) — NEW
  - **Weekly Strategy Digest** (10:00 Sundays, `78accee7`) — NEW
  - **Market Pulse Newsletter Draft** (10:00 Thursdays, `4159407a`) — NEW, Substack long (1000-1500w) + LinkedIn short (500-700w)
  - **Daily Substack Note** (11:00 daily, `a3f5773e`) — NEW

### Content Pipeline — Market Pulse
- Brand: Market Pulse
- Substack: https://marketpuls.substack.com
- LinkedIn Newsletter: https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/market-pulse-by-marcel-melzig-7294719790542143490
- Cadence: Weekly newsletter (Thu) + daily Substack Notes (11:00) + LinkedIn posts (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Drafts saved to: `documents/{newsletter,substack-notes,linkedin-drafts}/`
- Auto-posting to Substack planned — needs `substack-api` + Marcel's `substack.sid` cookie

### AI Impact on Fashion Ebook
- Full ebook draft complete: `documents/ai-impact-on-fashion_ebook_draft.md`
- Sections I-IV written (~7,500 words, 25-28 pages)
- Raw PDF generated via puppeteer at `/tmp/pdf-gen/`
- Professional designed HTML+PDF sub-agent spawned (cover page, author bio, SVGs, citations, typography)
- **Price: €19** on Gumroad — impulse buy for brand managers
- Gumroad listing copy drafted and sent (Telegram msg 789)
- Free lead magnet = 3-5 page excerpt (not the full ebook)

### Digital Product Strategy
- Product ladder: Free lead magnets → €7-19 guides → €29-49 reports → €99-199 consulting bridges
- Lower ticket (€7-€49) for higher volume
- Next product options: Sportswear Positioning Report or AI Implementation Scorecard (Marcel's pick)

### Gumroad Store
- URL: https://marcelmelzig.gumroad.com/ — "Market Pulse Pro"
- Existing: Branding Mistakes (free), Logo Guide (free/PWYW), Fashion Brand Clarity (€7), Luxury Resale Guide (has premium tier with call)

### Design Style Reference
- Asked Marcel to upload his previous ebooks (Luxury Resale Guide, Fashion Brand Clarity Guide) for design matching
- New ebooks should be visually consistent with existing Gumroad products

### Infra Notes
- pandoc, puppeteer, md-to-pdf installed
- No browser on machine (Chrome/Brave/Edge) — puppeteer workaround at `/tmp/pdf-gen/`
- Memory search was hitting OpenAI embeddings 429 errors
- nano-pdf skill available for PDF editing

## Decisions
- All content drafts sent to Marcel for review before publishing (no auto-publish)
- One big overnight project > five small things
- Communication always in English
- Voice: data-driven, opinionated, systems-thinking, confident; NO hashtags, NO emojis, NO filler phrases

## Cost Optimization — Model Tiering
Moved 4 cron jobs from Opus 4.6 → Gemini 2.5 Flash (~100x cheaper):
- Morning Brief → Flash
- Daily Substack Note → Flash
- LinkedIn Pipeline → Flash
- Afternoon Deep-Dive → Flash

Kept on Opus 4.6 (need top quality):
- Market Pulse Newsletter (weekly, long-form)
- Weekly Strategy Digest (synthesis)
- Overnight Autonomous Projects (coding/building)
- Main session (direct chat)

## Standing Orders
- **Track AI model releases** — flag when cheaper/better models drop that could replace current stack
- Current sweet spot: Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.15/$0.60) — 3.0 Flash exists but 5x more expensive on output, not worth it yet
- **Sub-agents default to OpenRouter Auto** — not Opus. Opus only for main chat + overnight coding
- **Cost alert**: Hit $30 on Opus in one day mostly from ebook sub-agents — avoid this going forward

### Ebook Design Iterations (Afternoon)
- **Marcel uploaded previous ebooks** — extracted design style guide to `documents/reference-ebooks/DESIGN-STYLE-GUIDE.md`
  - Font: Montserrat family + StarShield for cover
  - Colors: White #FFFFFF, Black #000000, Cyan #00ADEE
  - Cover: Blue gradient, highlight bars, circular author photo
  - Interior: White bg, dark header bar, page numbers top-left, large stacked titles
  - Format: A4 (595×842pt = 1123px page height in puppeteer)
- **v2**: Rebuilt to match design system (23pp, 6 charts) — "much better but too much empty space"
- **v3**: Made denser — overcorrected, sections bleeding together
- **v4**: Split sections onto fresh pages — overflow pages lacked header/page number framing. **This became the "golden base" for future versions.**
- **v5**: Used puppeteer `displayHeaderFooter` — "much better" but cover/CTA needed work
- **v6**: Full redesign via Opus sub-agent (2,084-line HTML) — "the worst of all", page numbers overlapping, blank gaps, titles cut off. **$30 Opus spend mostly from this.** Abandoned `displayHeaderFooter` approach entirely.
- **v7 (WIP)**: Started from v4 base. Strategy: measure `scrollHeight` per page div, split overflows into new pages.
  - Measured all pages — 4 overflows found:
    - Index 3 (Section I): 1771px → split after chart, I.3+ moved to new page ✅
    - Index 10 (IV.3–IV.6): 1200px → split "IV.6 Who Wins" to new page ✅
    - Index 12 (Section V): 1255px → **still needs splitting**
    - Index 13 (Section V cont): 1197px → **still needs splitting**
  - Still needs: finish 2 splits, renumber all pages, re-measure, generate final PDF

### Key Lesson — PDF Generation
- `displayHeaderFooter` approach DOES NOT WORK for styled PDFs — causes overlapping, blank gaps
- Embedded header divs in each page div + zero-margin puppeteer config = correct approach
- Large HTML files (2000+ lines) too big for cheap models (8192 max output) — need Opus for full rewrites
- v4 is the golden base: embedded page headers, zero margins, proper framing

## Cost Optimization Updates
- Revised model tiering (final):
  - **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Morning Brief, Afternoon Deep-Dive, LinkedIn Pipeline, Market Pulse Newsletter, Weekly Strategy Digest
  - **DeepSeek V3**: Daily Substack Note (simplest task)
  - **Opus 4.6**: Overnight Projects only + main session
- Researched Gemini 3 Flash — 5x more expensive on output ($3/M vs $0.60/M), staying on 2.5 Flash
- Machine: 16GB RAM / 10 CPUs — limits local Ollama to ≤20B models

## Blocked
- X and Threads handles not yet provided by Marcel
- Substack auto-posting not set up yet
- Ebook v7 has 2 remaining overflow pages to fix before final PDF
