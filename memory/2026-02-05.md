## Evening Session (19:58 - 20:16)

### Audio Transcription Issues
- **Problem:** Unable to process incoming audio messages from Marcel
- **Tools attempted:** `openai_whisper_api`, `openai_whisper` — both reported "not found"
- **Context:** Audio processing was working earlier today (message_id:645 had transcript)
- **Status:** Unresolved — tool availability issue; Marcel insists I fix it myself
- **Priority:** HIGH — Marcel frustrated with inconsistent capabilities

### YouTube Transcription/Summarization
- **Goal:** Transcribe/summarize YouTube videos
- **ClawHub skill investigated:** `https://clawhub.ai/abe238/youtube-summarizer`
- **Blocker:** `clawhub` CLI not available in environment
- **Alternative paths discussed:** `yt-dlp` + Whisper (also blocked), manual installation steps
- **Status:** Unresolved

### Cron Jobs
- **Proactive Coder:** Marcel requested change from 23:00 → 20:00
- **Finding:** A 20:00 Proactive Coder job already exists and ran successfully today
- **Also exists:** 23:00 Proactive Coder job (duplicate)
- **Action needed:** Clarify with Marcel whether to remove the 23:00 job

### Communication Feedback
- Marcel flagged responses as too long and difficult to follow
- **Action:** Keep responses concise, structured, digestible

### System Alert
- Cron error: "Memory Search commentary not found" — indicates tool/function issue

*Session note: Keep responses singular and clean. No repetition. Be concise.*
