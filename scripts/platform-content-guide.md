# Platform Content Structure Guide

## Daily Posting Schedule (Berlin Time)
- **15:00** - X (Twitter) - Sharp takes
- **17:00** - Substack Notes - Deep analysis  
- **19:00** - Threads - Engaging questions
- **21:00** - Instagram - Visual storytelling

## Platform-Specific Content Structure

### X (280 chars max)
**Format**: Hook + insight + (implied action)
**Tone**: Sharp, decisive, no-nonsense
**Example Structure**:
```
Fashion brands are making a critical mistake with AI. 

They're automating the wrong things.

Customer service? Automated.
Creative strategy? Still manual.

This is backwards.
```

### Threads (500 chars optimal)
**Format**: Hook + context + question for engagement
**Tone**: Conversational but authoritative
**Example Structure**:
```
The luxury resale market just hit €33B globally.

But here's what most brands miss: this isn't just about sustainability messaging. It's about customer lifetime value.

When customers can resell your products easily, they buy more frequently.

Are you factoring resale value into your pricing strategy?
```

### Instagram (500-800 chars optimal)
**Format**: Hook + context + strategic insight + call to action
**Tone**: Professional authority, visual storytelling mindset
**Example Structure**:
```
The fashion industry is at an inflection point.

Brands that understand consumer behavior shifts will outperform those that don't.

This is about more than trends — it's about fundamental changes in how people think, shop, and engage with brands.

The data tells a clear story. The question is: are you listening?

### Substack Notes (1000 chars max)
**Format**: Deep dive + implications + monitoring points
**Tone**: Analyst-grade, McKinsey-style
**Example Structure**:
```
AI adoption in fashion supply chains accelerated 340% in Q4 2025.

This signals a broader shift in how brands are approaching operational efficiency. The implications for strategic positioning are significant.

Worth monitoring: how quickly competitors adapt to this new reality.

The brands moving first will capture disproportionate advantage. The brands moving last will pay premium prices for commoditized solutions.

Strategic implication: AI isn't just a tool anymore. It's table stakes for competitive positioning.
```
