## Every 2 hours - Basic checks

- **Memory**: Read today's memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — any open tasks or blockers?
- **Apple Notes**: Check `memo list` for any todos (keep brief)
- **Weather**: Quick Düsseldorf forecast if 8am-6pm
- **Git**: Check for any uncommitted changes in workspace

**Rules:**
- Be concise. Only report if something needs attention.
- If all clear, just respond: "All clear — no action needed."
- Don't repeat information Marcel already knows.
