![LinkedIn Hero Image](/documents/newsletter/images/YYYY-MM-DD/linkedin-hero-branded.jpg)

[Opening: 2-3 sentences max. Start with the insight, not the setup.]

Example:

## The Core Insight

[Expand on the main point. 150-200 words. One clear argument.]

[Use bullets for supporting points:]

• **The Data**: [Key metric + source]
• **The Context**: [Why now?]
• **The Implication**: [So what?]

---

## Why This Matters

[Connect to broader trend. 100-150 words.]

[Take a position. Don't be neutral.]

---

## The Question for You

[Engagement prompt. Ask a specific question that invites comment.]

Example:
> Are you seeing this recovery in your segment, or is the bifurcation making it harder to read the market? Drop a comment — curious how this is playing out across different categories.

[Optional: One sentence CTA or P.S.]
