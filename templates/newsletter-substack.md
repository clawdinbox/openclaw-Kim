## Opening: The Big Picture

[2-3 sentences setting the context. What's happening in the market? Why does this matter now?]

Example:
> LVMH's Q4 earnings just dropped, and the numbers tell a story that goes beyond luxury. While the group's revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the real signal is in geography: China is recovering faster than anyone predicted, and the US premium consumer is back. Here's what this means for the entire ecosystem.

## The Signal: [Main Story Headline]

[Deep dive into the most important development. This should be 400-600 words.]

- **Operating Margin**: 22.3% (up 40bps)
- **China Recovery**: +18% vs. Q3's +5%
- **Source**: LVMH Q4 2025 Earnings Call, January 28, 2026

## Closing: One Insight

[One punchy takeaway. Memorable. Shareable.]

Example:
> The luxury recovery isn't uniform — it's bifurcated. The ultra-high-net-worth consumer never left, but the aspirational buyer is still cautious. Brands that recognize this and adjust their portfolio mix will win 2026. Those that don't will wonder why their promotions aren't working.

**Thanks for reading.**
