# Day Zero

First day of operation. Fresh workspace, clean slate.

## Setup

- **Marcel** defined the operating context: founder, strategist, analyst working across fashion, luxury, sportswear, resale, and culture
- **Kim 🦞** initialized as operator + analyst + execution layer
- Operating principle established: *Make Marcel faster, clearer, and harder to outcompete*

## Security Baseline

Ran initial security audit on the host machine:
- macOS 26.2 with FileVault enabled
- Time Machine backups configured
- OpenClaw 2026.2.2-3 (latest version)
- Fixed credentials directory permissions (755→700)
- Tightened agent directory permissions
- Note: macOS Firewall still disabled (requires manual enable)

## Systems Deployed

1. **Morning Brief (08:00)** — Weather, YouTube feeds, tasks, curated stories, recommendations
2. **Afternoon Report (14:00)** — Deep-dive research on relevant topics
3. **Proactive Coder (23:00)** — Build tools, create PRs, improve workflows
