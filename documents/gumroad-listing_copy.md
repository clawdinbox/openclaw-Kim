## Description

**The fashion industry is at an inflection point.**

AI is no longer a "tool layer" — it's becoming a **system layer** that compresses cycle time, expands creative search, and rewires how demand is sensed and supplied.

This 24-page strategic playbook is for brand leaders, strategists, and decision-makers who need to understand what's actually happening (not just the hype) and what to do about it.
