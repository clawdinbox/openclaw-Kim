## Full Description

### **The sportswear landscape is shifting faster than headlines suggest.**

While most coverage focuses on sneaker drops and quarterly earnings, the real story is in the competitive dynamics:

**→ Adidas** is executing a post-Yeezy recovery with +13% growth and a €1B buyback  
**→ Nike** is fighting a "Win Now" turnaround amid declining market dominance  
**→ Anta** just spent €1.5B on Puma — the biggest M&A move since Adidas-Reebok in 2005  
**→ Lululemon** is down 57% YTD under pressure from Alo Yoga, On, and Hoka  
**→ Under Armour** shows signs of stabilization after losing Steph Curry  
**→ Puma** is restructuring as ownership changes hands

**Same industry. Six different trajectories.**
