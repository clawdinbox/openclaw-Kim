# Promo Posts — Sportswear Intelligence Report Launch

## LINKEDIN POST (Long-form)

**Option A: Direct Value Post**

I just published a 21-page competitive intelligence report on the sportswear industry.

It's free.

Here's what's inside:

**The Divergence**
Adidas: Record revenues, €1B buyback, stock up 2.4%  
Nike: Turnaround pressure, DTC challenges, "Win Now" strategy  
Same industry. Opposite trajectories.

**The Disruption**
Anta's €1.5B Puma acquisition isn't just M&A. It's a direct challenge to the Nike-Adidas duopoly that's defined this industry for decades.

**The Pressure**
Lululemon down 57% YTD. Under Armour stabilizing after losing Steph Curry. Puma restructuring as ownership changes hands.

The report covers all 6 brands:
→ Nike, Adidas, Anta, Puma, Under Armour, Lululemon

Each profile includes:
• Strategic priorities
• Recent moves (M&A, leadership, product)  
• Financial trends
• Strengths vs. vulnerabilities
• What to watch in 2026

Plus: Competitive matrix comparing all players side-by-side.

**Why free?**
Two reasons:

1. I believe in value-first. If this is useful, you'll remember who wrote it.

2. The real insights happen in conversation. Download it, read it, tell me what I missed.

**Option B: Contrarian Hook**

Everyone's talking about Adidas's recovery.

No one's talking about what happens if it actually works.

Here's the scenario nobody's pricing in:

Adidas sustains momentum through 2026. Nike's turnaround takes longer than expected. Anta successfully integrates Puma and gains Western market share.

Result: The Nike-Adidas duopoly becomes a three-way race — with a Chinese player holding significant leverage.

This changes everything for:
→ Wholesale negotiations
→ Athlete endorsement economics  
→ Retail shelf space allocation
→ M&A valuations

I mapped this scenario — and 5 others — in a new competitive intelligence report.

**21 pages covering:**
• Nike's turnaround vulnerabilities
• Adidas's sustainability risks  
• Anta's integration execution
• Puma's restructuring uncertainty
• Under Armour's stabilization path
• Lululemon's competitive pressure

Plus: What to watch, when to watch it, and who wins under each scenario.

## X POST (Thread)

**Thread Option:**

The sportswear industry is diverging.

Adidas: Record revenues, €1B buyback  
Nike: Turnaround mode, DTC pressure  
Anta: €1.5B Puma acquisition

Same industry. Three different stories.

I spent the last week mapping competitive dynamics across all 6 major players.

Here's what the data says 🧵

[1/6]

---

**Nike's "Win Now" strategy:**

• Focus on core geographies
• Wholesale partnership revival  
• Product innovation acceleration

The bet: Streamline to win back market share.

The risk: Streamlining takes time. Adidas isn't waiting.

**Adidas's post-Yeezy recovery:**

• Record 2025 revenues
• Heritage products (Samba) driving growth
• €500M+ from Yeezy inventory sold

CEO Bjørn Gulden achieved a 4-year turnaround plan in 3 years.

The question: Can they sustain without Yeezy tailwinds?

[3/6]

**Anta's €1.5B Puma acquisition:**

• 29% stake with path to control
• Immediate Western market access
• World's 3rd largest sportswear group

This isn't just M&A. It's a direct challenge to the Nike-Adidas duopoly.
