**Post 1: Short & Punchy**

Adidas: record revenues, €1B buyback ✅  
Nike: turnaround pressure, DTC struggles ⚠️  
Anta: €1.5B Puma deal, Western push 🌍

Same industry. Three different stories.

I mapped all 6 major players in a free 21-page report.

**Post 2: Question Hook**

Who's actually winning in sportswear right now?

Adidas looks strong — record revenues, stock buyback.  
Nike is rebuilding — "Win Now" strategy, new leadership.  
Anta is expanding — €1.5B for Puma, Western markets.

I spent last week analyzing all 6 brands. Wrote it up in a free report.

21 pages. No fluff. Just data.

**Post 4: Lululemon Angle (Trending)**

Lululemon is down 57% YTD.

Not a typo. Fifty-seven percent.

Competition from Alo Yoga, On Running, Hoka is eating their lunch. Inventory levels are elevated. The "Power of Three x2" strategy has a lot to prove.

I covered Lulu's challenges (and the other 5 brands) in a free report.

**Post 5: Contrarian Take**

Everyone's talking about Adidas's recovery.

No one's talking about what happens if it actually works.

Scenario: Adidas sustains momentum. Nike's turnaround takes longer. Anta successfully integrates Puma.

Result: The duopoly becomes a three-way race — with a Chinese player holding leverage.

This changes everything.
