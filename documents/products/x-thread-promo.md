# X Thread — Sportswear Intelligence Report Launch

**Tweet 1/6 (Hook):**
The sportswear industry is diverging.

Adidas: Record revenues, €1B buyback ✅  
Nike: Turnaround mode, DTC pressure ⚠️  
Anta: €1.5B Puma deal, going global 🌍

Same industry. Three different stories.

I spent the last week mapping competitive dynamics across all 6 major players.

Here's what the data says 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/6 (Nike):**
Nike's "Win Now" strategy:

• Focus on core geographies
• Wholesale partnership revival  
• Product innovation acceleration

The bet: Streamline to win back market share.

The risk: Streamlining takes time. Adidas isn't waiting.

**Tweet 3/6 (Adidas):**
Adidas's post-Yeezy recovery:

• Record 2025 revenues
• Heritage products (Samba) driving growth
• €500M+ from Yeezy inventory sold

CEO Bjørn Gulden achieved a 4-year turnaround plan in 3 years.

The question: Can they sustain without Yeezy tailwinds?

**Tweet 4/6 (Anta/Puma):**
Anta's €1.5B Puma acquisition:

• 29% stake with path to control
• Immediate Western market access
• World's 3rd largest sportswear group

This isn't just M&A. It's a direct challenge to the Nike-Adidas duopoly.

**Tweet 5/6 (The Insight):**

Market dynamics. Financial trends. Strategic outlook.
