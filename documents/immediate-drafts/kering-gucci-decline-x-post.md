## PRIMARY DRAFT (280 chars)

🚨 BREAKING: Kering's latest earnings show ANOTHER steep decline at Gucci. The luxury giant's turnaround efforts are failing to gain traction. After months of creative and executive shakeups, the brand's bleeding continues. Is this a structural problem that new leadership can't fix? $KER

---

## ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS

### Version A (Focus on severity)
Kering's Q4 results are brutal. Gucci sales plunged again despite Demna's appointment and all the restructuring. When does "transition period" stop being an excuse? The market wants results, not promises. #Luxury #FashionBusiness $KER

### Version B (Questioning strategy)
Another tough quarter for Kering = another reminder that luxury turnarounds take years, not quarters. But investors are losing patience. How many more declines before the board acts? $KER #Gucci

## THREAD OPTION (if more context needed)

Post 1/3 🚨 Kering just reported another brutal quarter for Gucci. Sales declining steeply despite new creative direction & exec shuffle. The turnaround narrative is wearing thin.

Post 2/3 What changed at Kering: New CEO (De Sarno out, new structure), new creative direction (Demna incoming), portfolio cleanup. What didn't: Top-line growth.

Post 3/3 The luxury market isn't waiting. While LVMH stabilizes and Hermès keeps climbing, Kering's stuck in reverse. The question isn't IF the board acts—it's WHEN. $KER
