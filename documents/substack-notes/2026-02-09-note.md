LVMH just posted €80.8 billion in 2025 sales. Organic growth down 1%, but that beat analyst expectations of -1.8%. The stock still dropped 8%, dragging Kering, Moncler, and Hermès with it.

Here's what Bernard Arnault said on the earnings call: "A family group isn't riveted to the quarterly results. We create products for the long term. We're not mesmerized by what's going to happen in the coming quarter."

The market panics. LVMH plans.

While competitors chase quarterly comps, Arnault is treating this as a recalibration window. The question isn't whether luxury recovers in Q1. It's whether the brands that stayed disciplined during the trough emerge structurally stronger.

The contrarian bet isn't on demand snapping back. It's on which conglomerates resisted the temptation to discount their way through the cycle.
