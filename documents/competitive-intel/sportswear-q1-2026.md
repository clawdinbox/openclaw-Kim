## 1. Nike

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** While direct historical price data was found, a precise summary of performance for Nov 2025 - Feb 2026 is not explicitly stated in the search results. However, news from late 2025 suggests a focus on turnaround strategies, implying that stock performance might be reacting to these initiatives and broader market conditions.
*   **Strategic priorities:** Nike is emphasizing a "Win Now" approach, focusing on core geographies, performance-focused categories like running, and strengthening wholesale partnerships. They aim to reposition NIKE Digital as a premium, full-price destination with sport-led storytelling and improve sell-through trends. The company is also working to accelerate product delivery through innovation.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Leadership:** Senior leadership changes were announced on December 3, 2025, with geography leaders joining the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) to accelerate strategic initiatives.
    *   **Innovation:** A new "Innovation Engine" was created by uniting the creation organization across Nike, Jordan, and Converse to speed up product development.
    *   **Partnerships:** Continued focus on impact partnerships (e.g., Better Work) and high-profile athlete endorsements are part of their strategy.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong brand recognition, established presence in key sports categories, significant innovation capabilities, and a global distribution network. The "Win Now" strategy and focus on wholesale aim to leverage existing strengths more effectively.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Increased competition, challenges in direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth expectations for fiscal 2026, and the need to navigate dynamic operating environments.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Nike's ability to translate its "Win Now" strategy into sustained revenue growth and market share gains amidst intense competition and evolving consumer preferences.

## 2. Adidas

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** Adidas reported record revenues for 2025 and announced a €1 billion share repurchase program to begin in February 2026. This news, coupled with expectations for continued recovery, led to a 2.4% rise in its Frankfurt-listed shares in early February 2026. Analyst forecasts also show a positive outlook for the stock in 2026.
*   **Strategic priorities:** Under CEO Bjørn Gulden, Adidas is executing a turnaround strategy focused on rebuilding the brand as premium and globally relevant. Key initiatives include a renewed emphasis on heritage products, a pivot back toward performance, and localized product offerings tailored to regional preferences (e.g., soccer in Europe, basketball in the U.S.). They are also managing the post-Yeezy inventory healthily.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Inventory Management:** Effective management of Yeezy inventory, generating over €500 million in 2024, and a strategy to sell off remaining stock "as healthy as possible" without rushing.
    *   **Product Focus:** Renewed attention to heritage products (like Samba) and performance categories.
    *   **Financials:** Announced plans for a significant share buyback program in early 2026.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong brand legacy, successful turnaround under new leadership, effective crisis management (post-Yeezy), and strategic focus on core strengths like performance and heritage. Record revenues in 2025 and a planned share buyback indicate financial recovery.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** The shadow of the Yeezy partnership, although successfully navigated, still necessitates careful brand positioning. Potential vulnerability in relying heavily on specific heritage styles or performance categories if market trends shift.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Adidas's sustained recovery and ability to maintain its premium brand positioning and relevance in performance categories following the successful post-Yeezy turnaround.

## 3. Anta Sports

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** Due to a rate limit error with the search tool, specific stock performance data for Anta Sports from November 2025 to February 2026 could not be retrieved.
*   **Strategic priorities:** Anta's overarching strategy is to become the world's largest sportswear conglomerate. This involves strategic acquisitions (like Puma) to diversify its brand portfolio and gain significant presence in Western markets (US and Europe), which are considered key missing pieces. The company also focuses on investing in and expanding its retail presence, and leveraging its existing brands like Fila and Descente across different regions.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Acquisition:** Announced a deal to acquire a 29%+ stake in Puma for €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion), expected to close by end-2026.
    *   **Partnerships:** Signed basketball star Kyrie Irving, who is developing his signature sneaker with Anta.
    *   **Market Expansion:** Opened a flagship store in Beverly Hills, signaling a direct push into North American markets traditionally dominated by Nike and Lululemon.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong existing brand portfolio (Anta, Fila China, Descente), proven ability to expand brands within Asia, aggressive acquisition strategy to gain global reach, significant investment in key athletes like Kyrie Irving, and ambition to become a global leader.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** The Anta brand itself has limited recognition outside Asia, making entry into the US and European markets a significant challenge. The success of the Puma acquisition and integration is crucial. Over-reliance on acquisitions for global expansion.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Anta's ability to successfully integrate Puma and leverage its expanded portfolio to challenge Nike and Adidas globally, particularly in Western markets.

## 4. Puma

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** Puma's stock experienced a notable jump around late January 2026 following the announcement of the Anta Sports stake purchase. As of February 8, 2026, its trading price was €22.70 on XETRA. Despite this positive reaction to the sale news, underlying performance metrics suggest challenges, with some sources indicating poor profit performance and declining sales in preceding periods. Analyst forecasts show a generally negative outlook for the stock in the immediate future, with a projected decrease from its current price.
*   **Strategic priorities:** Puma's CEO has indicated that 2025 is a "reset year" for the company, with 2026 envisioned as a "transition year." The company has been navigating slower demand, competitive pressures, and underperforming product segments, leading to a necessary turnaround strategy. The sale of a significant stake suggests a strategic shift, possibly to unlock value and fund a more focused turnaround.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Sale of Stake:** The Pinault family (via Artemis) agreed to sell its 29% stake to Anta Sports for €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion). This was stated to be "not strategic" for Artemis, who are focusing on Gucci.
    *   **Restructuring:** Plans include cutting 900 corporate jobs worldwide by the end of 2026 as part of restructuring efforts.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong brand recognition and heritage in certain categories (especially lifestyle and sports fashion). The sale to Anta brings potential investment and a new strategic direction.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Significant challenges with poor profit performance, declining sales, slower demand, and intense competition. The need for a major turnaround strategy and the large-scale job cuts highlight internal struggles.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Puma's ability to execute its turnaround strategy and regain market momentum following the significant stake sale and internal restructuring.

## 5. Under Armour

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** Under Armour's stock has shown volatility, with recent closing prices around $7.56 in early February 2026. While Q3 fiscal 2026 revenue was reported at $1.33 billion (exceeding analyst expectations), the company incurred a large GAAP loss. However, adjusted profit and full-year EPS guidance have improved, suggesting a potential for future recovery. The stock price history indicates a significant decline from its peak values in previous years.
*   **Strategic priorities:** The company is in a more stable and disciplined phase of its turnaround, focusing on improved execution, streamlined operations, and leadership alignment. CEO Kevin Plank indicated that the "most disruptive" phase of the turnaround is over, and operations have been simplified, reducing friction. The strategy aims for greater visibility into fiscal 2026, targeting $110 million in operating income.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Leadership Changes:** Americas President Kara Trent moved to Chief Merchandising Officer, and Adam Peake was promoted to Americas President.
    *   **Product Strategy:** Revenue saw declines in apparel (especially run and golf) and footwear, attributed to demand challenges and optimization efforts. The final Curry Brand x Under Armour shoe, the Curry 13, is slated for release in February 2026, with continued community and youth-sports efforts planned.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Improved operational execution and a clearer strategic direction under new/aligned leadership. Exceeding revenue expectations in recent quarters and improved adjusted profit/EPS guidance signal positive momentum. Continued association with high-profile athletes like Steph Curry (even as the partnership evolves).
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Declining revenue in key categories like apparel and footwear, significant GAAP losses, and a stock price far below historical highs. The effectiveness of the simplified strategy in driving profitable growth remains to be fully seen.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Under Armour's ability to translate its "disciplined turnaround" phase into sustainable profitable growth and regain market share in its core apparel and footwear categories.

## 6. Lululemon

*   **Stock performance (last 3 months):** Lululemon's stock has experienced significant downward pressure recently. It dropped by approximately 20.1% in the month leading up to February 6, 2026, falling from $215.88 on January 6 to $172.54. By late November 2025, the stock had already seen a 57% decline year-to-date. This performance indicates a challenging period, though some reports suggest the worst might be over. In December 2025, the company announced an increase of $1.0 billion to its stock repurchase program.
*   **Strategic priorities:** Lululemon is executing its "Power of Three x2" growth strategy, aiming for $12.5 billion in revenue by 2026. This involves expansion into new categories like footwear and men's apparel, international growth (especially in China and India), and enhancing its digital presence. The company is focusing on elevating inventory levels and increasing operational efficiency.
*   **Recent major moves (launches, partnerships, leadership):**
    *   **Footwear Expansion:** Beyond the initial "Blissfeel" women's runner, Lululemon has launched a full men's footwear line, including "Cityverse" and "Beyondfeel" performance shoes.
    *   **International Growth:** Continued focus on expanding into markets like China and India.
    *   **Financials:** Announced a $1 billion increase to its stock repurchase program in December 2025.
*   **Strengths vs vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong brand loyalty and premium positioning in the athleisure market, successful expansion into footwear and men's categories, growing international presence, and a clear growth strategy with substantial stock buyback authorization.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Significant recent stock price decline, elevated inventory levels risking increased markdowns, heightened competition from both established sportswear brands and specialized athleisure players (e.g., Alo Yoga, On Running, Hoka), and potential shifts in consumer sentiment. Leadership changes (post-Sun Choe) may also introduce uncertainty.
*   **1-line take: "What to watch":** Lululemon's ability to reignite stock performance and achieve its ambitious revenue targets amidst intense competition and inventory headwinds.
