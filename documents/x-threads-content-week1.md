[Tweet 1 - Hook]
I spent 3 months analyzing how AI is reshaping fashion's value chain.

What I found: Most brands are focused on the wrong thing.

Here's the reality of where AI actually creates leverage in fashion 👇

---

[Tweet 2 - The Gap]
Everyone's obsessing over AI design tools.

Midjourney moodboards. Generative prints. Virtual samples.

Useful? Yes.

But the real competitive advantage isn't in the design studio.

---

[Tweet 3 - The Real Shift]
It's in the layer nobody talks about:

Demand sensing.

Zara's parent company spent €2.5B on systems that read real-time sell-through data and optimize allocation across 5,700+ stores.

Their logistics center processes 2.5M items daily.

AI decides where each item goes.

---

[Tweet 4 - The Economics]
Fashion destroys 30-40% of inventory annually through markdowns and waste.

AI-driven demand forecasting cuts this by 20-50%.

At a $1B brand, that's $20-40M in recovered margin.

Design tools are nice.

Predicting what sells is everything.

---

[Tweet 5 - The 5 Shifts]
I mapped 5 shifts reshaping fashion in 2026:

1. Experimentation → Infrastructure
2. Solo designer → Human-AI collaboration  
3. Forecasting → Demand sensing
4. Content scarcity → Content abundance
5. Sustainability narrative → Measurable systems

---

[Tweet 6 - Who Wins]
The brands winning in 2026 have something in common:

They started the AI flywheel early.

Data → Insights → Decisions → Actions → More Data

Each implementation makes the next one better.

Compounding advantage.

---

[Tweet 7 - The Framework]
Most brands don't need more AI pilots.

They need a strategic framework for:
- Which use cases to prioritize
- How to measure ROI
- How to build internal buy-in
- Where to start in the next 90 days

---

[Tweet 8 - The Playbook]
I built a 24-page Strategic Playbook covering:

→ AI across the full value chain
→ Competitive implications
→ The AI Flywheel framework
→ 90-day implementation roadmap

Not surface-level trends. Analyst-grade strategy.

# Week 1: Daily Posts

## Day 2 — Reply Strategy
Find 10 posts about AI + fashion. Add value, soft mention.

Example reply template:
"Great point. I researched this for a playbook on AI in fashion — found that [specific insight]. Covered the full framework there if helpful."

---

## Day 3 — Contrarian Take
"3 AI myths fashion brands believe:

Myth 1: AI will replace designers
Reality: It augments them. The premium is on taste and curation, not production speed.

Myth 2: You need a data science team
Reality: Start with one use case, prove value, fund expansion.

Myth 3: More AI = competitive advantage
Reality: Clear strategy = advantage. More experiments = chaos."

---

## Day 4 — Case Study Format
"How Nike uses AI (thread):

Nike's computational design team integrates generative tools into exploration — not to replace designers, but to increase creative search surface area.

They generate thousands of variations and narrow by constraint: brand DNA, cost, trend alignment.

Result: More options evaluated faster.

The designer's job shifts from drafting to directing.

This is the model: AI expands search. Human owns taste."

---

## Day 5 — Behind the Scenes
"What I learned researching AI in fashion:

→ The best case studies aren't public (NDAs)
→ The real ROI is in boring places (allocation, replenishment)
→ Most "AI transformations" are 3 PowerBI dashboards and a chatbot
→ The gap between leaders and laggards is 5 years and widening

Real competitive advantage is quiet."

---

## Day 6 — The 90-Day Sprint
"AI implementation that actually works:

Days 1-30: Foundation
- Audit current tools
- Identify 3 quick wins
- Assemble task force

Days 31-60: Pilot
- Launch one project
- Measure everything
- Document learnings

Days 61-90: Scale
- Evaluate results
- Build business case
- Secure Phase 2 budget

Start small. Prove value. Expand.

Not: pilot 12 things, prove nothing, lose budget."

Threads allows longer, more conversational content.

## Thread 1: The Shift No One's Talking About
"Everyone's showing off their AI-generated moodboards.

Meanwhile, the brands actually winning with AI are doing something completely different.

They're not using it to design better.

They're using it to KNOW better.

To sense demand in real time.
To allocate inventory dynamically.
To predict what sells before they make it.

The design tools get the hype.

The demand sensing gets the margin.

I've spent 3 months mapping how AI is reshaping fashion's value chain.
