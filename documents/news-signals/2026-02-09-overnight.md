## 🔶 Signal 1: Hermès Orange → iPhone China Revival (ASIA)
Apple's iPhone 17 "cosmic orange" went viral on Chinese social media (Douyin/Xiaohongshu/Weibo), rechristened as "Hermès orange" by consumers. The color choice resonates culturally (Mandarin "chéng" = orange = success). Result: 38% YoY surge in China iPhone sales to $26B, ending 18-month decline. LVMH, Burberry also reporting improved Chinese sales — suggesting broader luxury recovery tailwinds.
