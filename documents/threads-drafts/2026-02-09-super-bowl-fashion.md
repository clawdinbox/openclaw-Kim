# Super Bowl Fashion Post — Threads Draft

**Hook:**
The Super Bowl is now fashion's biggest ad buy. Not the Oscars. Not the Met Gala.

**Body:**

$10M for 30 seconds. That's what brands paid to reach 120M viewers last night.

But here's what most missed:

Thom Browne didn't buy an ad. He dressed the GQ Bowl players. Abercrombie became the NFL's official fashion partner. Rolex, Breitling, Omega poured millions into sideline visibility.

The playbook shifted.

Luxury used to chase Hollywood. Now it's chasing helmets.

Why? The Oscars audience is shrinking (-60% since 2014). NFL viewership is flat — but engagement is through the roof. And the demo? 18-49, $75K+ household income, 45% female.

That's the customer.

**Close:**
Which luxury brand figures this out first for 2026?

Split-screen graphic:
- Left: Old playbook (Oscars red carpet, actress in gown)
- Right: New playbook (NFL sideline, player in designer coat)
- Bottom: "$10M vs. Cultural relevance"

**Alt angle:**
Could also frame as "The 3 brands who understood the assignment" — Abercrombie, Thom Browne, [one watch brand] — and what their competitors missed.
