Coming next week:
• Supply chain regionalization—friend-shoring vs efficiency
• Wholesale isn't dead but it's being reinvented
• Direct retail economics: why DTC is harder than the 2010s made it look

If this week was about market dynamics, next week is about infrastructure choices.

Any specific angles you want covered?
