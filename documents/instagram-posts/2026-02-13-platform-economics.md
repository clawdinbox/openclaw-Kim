# Friday: Platform Economics

**Visual Concept:** Abstract visualization of marketplace dominance — StockX/GOAT logos at center with brand satellites orbiting. Shows power dynamic: platforms own the customer relationship. Minimalist, conceptual, cyan accents.

**Caption:**
StockX and GOAT move B+ in sneakers yearly.

That is larger than most footwear brands they sell.

The platforms now own:
→ The customer relationship
→ The pricing data
→ The authentication trust

Brands are becoming suppliers to marketplaces they do not control.

How long until this flips in apparel too?
