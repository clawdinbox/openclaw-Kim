# Thursday: Sportswear Divergence

**Visual Concept:** Four-quadrant grid showing Adidas (green/up), Nike (yellow/flat), Under Armour (red/down), Puma (orange/stable). Each quadrant has brand logo + simple trend arrow. Clean typography, data-driven aesthetic.

**Caption:**
Q4 earnings tell a story of divergence.

Adidas: 13% growth, buying back stock
Nike: restructuring, job cuts
Under Armour: turnaround mode, lost Curry
Puma: stable, seeking direction

Same market. Different playbooks.

The sportswear landscape is splitting. Execution matters more than heritage right now.
