## Agentic Commerce: A Brief Explainer

Agentic commerce represents the vanguard of online retail, powered by advanced AI agents that act autonomously on behalf of consumers. This paradigm shift moves beyond traditional e-commerce by enabling AI entities to conduct complex shopping tasks such as price comparison, negotiation, and direct purchase decisions, all without direct human intervention.

The significance for brands is profound. In an era where AI agents are increasingly making purchase decisions, brands must evolve to be discoverable and optimized for these non-human "shoppers." Traditional marketing and sales strategies, honed for human attention and cognitive biases, may become obsolete. Brands optimized solely for human engagement could find themselves invisible to the algorithms that will soon dominate transaction flows.

The emergence of protocols like the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) aims to standardize secure and efficient interactions between AI agents and businesses, paving the way for a seamless, hyper-personalized, and automated shopping future. Preparing for agentic commerce now is crucial for brands to thrive in the next wave of digital retail.
