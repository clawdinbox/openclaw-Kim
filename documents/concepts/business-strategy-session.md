# Business Strategy Session — Feb 4, 2026

## Current State

**Revenue streams:**
- Sponsored posts: €5,000 (2 posts confirmed)
- Substack paid: ~€110/month (11 subs @ €10)
- Gumroad: ~€40 (1 sale - Resale Guide)
- Consulting: €0 (warm leads, no conversion yet)

**Assets:**
- 1,000+ Substack subs (2 months)
- Strong LinkedIn presence (articles getting 15-57 comments)
- Partners: LIGANOVA, Luxurynsight, Heuritech
- Featured in Vogue Business
- Booking links live
- Gumroad products created

**Warm leads:**
- Salomon
- Nike ACG
- GMG GCC
- Marc von Casablanca

## Diagnosis

Gap between audience and conversion. People read Marcel's content → think "smart guy" → leave. No clear bridge from content to hiring.

## Next Actions (to revisit)

1. **Content → Offer bridge:** End 1 in 5 posts with consulting CTA
2. **Warm leads activation:** Direct DM with specific offer
3. **More sponsored posts:** €2,500/post opportunity
4. **Clarify one-sentence offer**

## Open Questions

- What's the specific offer for each warm lead?
- What consulting package converts best at this stage?
- Can Substack drive consulting leads?
