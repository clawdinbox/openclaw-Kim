# Under Armour's "Less Is More" Pivot: A Case Study in Sportswear Premiumization

**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Thesis:** Under Armour's radical SKU reduction and Curry Brand spinoff mark a broader industry inflection point—winners in 2026 won't be those with the most products, but those with the clearest brand positioning.

---

## Context

On February 6, 2026, Under Armour reported Q3 FY2026 results that told a counterintuitive story: revenue down 5% to $1.33 billion, but adjusted EPS of $0.09 crushed expectations of a small loss. The stock rallied 40% in the three months leading up to the report.

What's happening? Founder Kevin Plank, who returned as CEO in April 2024, is executing the final phase of a three-year turnaround. The playbook: reduce SKUs by 25%, exit low-quality wholesale relationships, spin off the Curry Brand as an independent entity, and reposition the core brand around "better and best" product tiers (Vanish Elite, Meridian collections).

The numbers reveal the strategy's early success. North America revenue fell 10% to $757 million—intentionally, as UA exited discount-heavy wholesale channels. But international markets are accelerating: Latin America up 20%, EMEA up 6%. Management raised full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $0.03-$0.05 to $0.10-$0.11—a doubling of profit expectations despite declining top-line revenue.

This isn't just an Under Armour story. The global athleisure market is projected at $244.58 billion in 2026 (Grand View Research), growing at 9.3% CAGR. But growth is concentrating. Lululemon, the premium athleisure leader, just lost CEO Calvin McDonald and CPO Sun Choe, with founder Chip Wilson launching a proxy fight claiming the brand has lost its technical DNA. Meanwhile, "new guard" specialists like On Running and Hoka are capturing the high-performance runner that Lululemon and Under Armour once targeted.

## Analysis

Under Armour's pivot represents a fundamental shift in sportswear strategy from **scale to selectivity**. The old playbook—maximize distribution, flood the market with SKUs, discount to move inventory—has collapsed under its own weight.

**The Value Chain Compression**

Plank's team is compressing the value chain vertically. By cutting 25% of SKUs, Under Armour reduces manufacturing complexity, inventory risk, and markdown pressure. The focus shifts to high-margin "best" tier products (Vanish Elite at premium price points) rather than competing on volume. Gross margins of 44.4% (down from tariff headwinds) have room to expand toward 47-50% as the product mix improves.

**The Curry Brand Separation**

The Curry Brand spinoff is equally strategic. Under Armour will still benefit from the partnership, but the separation achieves three goals: (1) de-risks the core brand from dependence on a single athlete's ecosystem, (2) allows Curry Brand to pursue its own premium positioning without UA's discount baggage, (3) creates a cleaner valuation story for investors. It's a recognition that athlete-brands have different lifecycle curves than corporate apparel brands.

**Competitive Positioning Map**

The 2026 sportswear landscape is fragmenting into three zones:

| Zone | Players | Strategy | Risk |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| **Premium Performance** | On, Hoka, Lululemon (men's) | Technical innovation, community | Saturation, competition |
| **Scale Giants** | Nike, Adidas | Portfolio breadth, marketing spend | Innovation lag, margin pressure |
| **Resurrected Specialists** | Under Armour | Niche dominance, operational discipline | Brand perception recovery |

Under Armour is betting on a fourth path: the "tough, gritty" performance niche for serious athletes—a space currently underserved as Lululemon chases wellness lifestyle and Nike/Adidas fight for mass market share.

## Contrarian Take

**The consensus view:** Under Armour's turnaround is working. Cost discipline is restoring profitability. The stock has bottomed.

**What everyone is missing:** Brand perception recovery is non-linear and potentially impossible for Gen Z consumers who associate Under Armour with discount racks at Dick's Sporting Goods. You can fix operations. You cannot fix "uncool" with cost-cutting.

Analyst Neil Saunders at GlobalData noted that even successful lines like Vanish are "getting buried under the brand's other products and a lack of strong brand positioning." Plank's "bolder storytelling" is aspirational, but storytelling requires distribution—and UA is intentionally shrinking its distribution footprint.

The deeper risk: the Curry Brand separation may unlock value, but it also removes the only emotionally resonant brand asset Under Armour had built in a decade. Steph Curry's cultural relevance exceeds Under Armour's by orders of magnitude. Without it, the core brand has... moisture-wicking fabric?

## So What for Marcel

**For client conversations:**
- Under Armour's playbook is a template for any brand caught in the "discount trap." The 25% SKU reduction model—painful but necessary—applies beyond sportswear to any category with margin compression.
- The Curry Brand separation illustrates a broader trend: athlete/celebrity brands are becoming independent entities (think: Michael Jordan's separation from Nike via Jordan Brand). This creates new licensing and partnership structures for clients to consider.

**For content strategy:**
- The "less is more" narrative is underexplored in business media. Most coverage focuses on growth, scale, expansion. A contrarian piece on strategic contraction—featuring Under Armour, but also parallel moves in other industries—would differentiate your perspective.
- Lululemon's leadership crisis + Under Armour's operational turnaround = a perfect compare/contrast on "what happens when founder DNA conflicts with professional management."

**For market positioning:**
- The 2026 sportswear landscape is a case study in positioning maps. Your "opportunity mapping" framework would apply directly here—showing clients how to identify white space when incumbents are distracted by internal restructuring.
