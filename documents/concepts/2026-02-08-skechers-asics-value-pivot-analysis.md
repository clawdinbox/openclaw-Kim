# The Value Pivot: How Skechers and ASICS Are Eating the Sportswear Middle

**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Topic:** Market positioning shift in global sportswear — the rise of "accessible performance"

---

## Thesis

While Nike and Adidas fight a two-front war against luxury upstarts and ultra-discounters, Skechers and ASICS are quietly capturing the lucrative middle market by redefining "performance" as comfort-plus-function at accessible price points—creating a new category that's growing faster than both premium and value tiers.

---

## Context

**The Numbers**

Skechers just posted another record quarter. The company achieved $8.97B in annual revenue (2024, +12.11% YoY) and is targeting $10B by 2026. More telling: international sales now represent 62% of revenue, heading toward 67% by 2026. In EMEA specifically, growth accelerated from 14% (Q1 2025) to 48.5% (Q2 2025)—a trajectory most brands would kill for.

ASICS EMEA is on a similar tear: +26.6% in Q2 2025, +17.7% in Q3 2025. Their SportStyle category (lifestyle running aesthetics) grew 43%+. The Gel-1130 and Gel-NYC models posted *triple-digit* growth.

Meanwhile, the market leaders are struggling. Nike's footwear sales (~$33B globally) are seeing market share decline of -0.3 percentage points in 2025 per retail analytics. Adidas (~$13B) is gaining slightly (+0.1pp), but the real share gains are going to Shein, Uniqlo, Skechers, and New Balance.

**What's Happening**

Skechers is executing a classic flank attack. For decades, they owned the "comfort for kids and retirees" niche. Starting in 2022—with the U.S. Open pickleball sponsorship—they began a systematic push into performance: soccer cleats (UK/Europe launch August 2023), basketball shoes (NBA signings including Julius Randle and Isaiah Hartenstein), and running. They're opening 150-170 company-owned stores in 2025 and investing $600-700M in distribution infrastructure across the U.S., China, and Europe.

ASICS, meanwhile, has ridden the "ugly running shoe" trend—retro-tech aesthetics that signal performance credibility without the €180+ price tag of Nike's flagship models.

## Analysis

**The Value-Performance Gap**

There's a structural opening in the market. Nike and Adidas have pushed premium pricing so aggressively that they've created a vacuum between €35 discount sneakers and €150+ flagship models. Skechers and ASICS are filling that gap with products positioned at €70-110 that deliver genuine technical credibility (Skechers' basketball line, ASICS' running heritage) without the brand tax.

**Channel Strategy Matters**

Skechers' DTC growth (+9% overall, +41% in EMEA) isn't just about cutting out wholesalers—it's about controlling the narrative. Their stores and website can tell the "comfort technology" story without competing for shelf space with Nike's marketing muscle. ASICS has achieved similar success with wholesale partners, but the dynamic is the same: they're not fighting Nike for wall placement in Foot Locker, they're building their own channels.

**Who Wins/Loses**

| Winner | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Skechers** | First-mover in "accessible performance," infrastructure investments paying off |
| **ASICS** | Heritage credibility + retro aesthetic perfectly timed for the cycle |
| **New Balance** | Similar playbook, already established |
| **Value retailers** (Decathlon, etc.) | Consumers trading down from premium brands |

| Loser | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Nike** | Over-indexed on premium, losing price-sensitive consumers |
| **Adidas** | Caught in the middle—not premium enough for luxury, not cheap enough for value |
| **Puma** | No clear positioning; losing share at both ends |
| **Mid-tier fashion brands** (Zara sportswear, etc.) | Can't match the technical credibility Skechers/ASICS now claim |

## Contrarian Take

**The consensus says:** Skechers is a temporary beneficiary of consumer caution—when wallets reopen, shoppers will return to Nike.

**What's actually happening:** Skechers isn't just capturing trade-downs. They're *expanding* the performance footwear category by bringing in consumers who were never going to buy €180 running shoes but will spend €90 on basketball sneakers endorsed by NBA players. This is category creation, not substitution.

The risk to Nike isn't that consumers temporarily choose Skechers—it's that Skechers redefines what "good enough" performance looks like for a massive segment of the market. Once you've worn a €90 Skechers basketball shoe that performs adequately, the €170 Nike doesn't feel 2x better. It just feels 2x more expensive.

## So What for Marcel

**Consulting Angle**

This shift has direct implications for any brand or retailer in your network:

1. **For multi-brand retailers:** The "Nike/Adidas or nothing" assortment strategy is increasingly risky. Skechers and ASICS are turning into traffic drivers, not filler. Floor space allocation needs recalibration.

2. **For emerging brands:** The middle market is now *more* contested, not less. Launching a €120 "premium but accessible" sneaker is harder today than 3 years ago. The playbook now requires either genuine technical differentiation (like ASICS' running heritage) or massive distribution muscle (like Skechers').

3. **For resale platforms:** Skechers has historically had minimal resale value. If their performance lines gain cultural traction (NBA signings, soccer cleats), this could change—creating new inventory opportunities.

**Content Opportunity**

This is an underreported story. The business press covers Nike's struggles and Hoka's growth, but Skechers' quiet dominance in the €70-110 segment hasn't been analyzed at depth. A LinkedIn piece on "The Middle Market Squeeze" with specific data on Skechers/ASICS growth vs. Nike/Adidas declines would perform well. The angle: "Everyone's watching the luxury sneaker boom and the Shein threat. The real story is in the middle."

**Client Conversation Starter**

"Are we thinking about price-value positioning correctly? The market is splitting into three tiers: luxury performance (€200+), accessible performance (€70-120), and pure value (<€50). Most brands are stuck in no-man's land between the second and third."
