Most companies claim AI use. The real edge? Deploying AI agents for specific operational tasks, not just chatbots. It's about delegation and augmentation.

AI agents excel at research, synthesis, scheduling, and coordination. They enable leaner teams to achieve more. A 3-person team with agents can outmaneuver a 10-person team without.

This is a shift from AI as a tool to AI as a delegate, performing workflows independently.

Agent-native companies are building for efficiency. AI laggards are not. The future is delegation.
