### X Post 2 — Kering/Luxury
Kering stock +12% on "less bad" earnings.

Q4: -3% revenue (vs -5% expected), €29M net loss for 2025.

But here's what matters: new CEO Luca de Meo is closing 100+ stores and slashing SKUs. The automotive turnaround playbook (ex-Renault) applied to luxury.

Watch April's Capital Markets Day. If Demna's Gucci debut lands, this becomes a case study in brand rehabilitation.

If not? Kering becomes a distressed asset play by 2027.

### X Post 3 — AI Shopping Agents
Google's AI agents can now purchase products directly.

JD Sports, Shopify, Etsy, Walmart racing to integrate.

The shift: AI-native shoppers won't browse—they'll delegate. "Find me running shoes under €150, sustainable, size 44."

Implication for brands: product data cleanliness becomes competitive advantage. The messy PIM systems of 2024 become liabilities in 2026.

Who's ready?

### X Post 4 — NYFW/Super Bowl
Fashion won the Super Bowl.

Bad Bunny in full Zara (custom). Abercrombie NFL partnership. halftime show = 27.7M viewers.

Then NYFW opens with Coach, Tory Burch, Michael Kors.

The pattern: cultural moments > traditional runway. Accessibility > exclusivity. Zara just achieved luxury-level cultural legitimacy—without the price point.

The old rules are dissolving.
