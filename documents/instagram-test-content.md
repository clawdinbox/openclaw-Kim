# Instagram Test Content

## Test Post #1 (Feb 6, 2026)

**Content**:
```
The fashion industry just crossed a critical threshold.

AI adoption in supply chains jumped 340% in Q4 2025. But most brands are still automating the wrong things.

Customer service chatbots? Everywhere.
Predictive trend analysis? Barely started.

The brands that get this right will capture disproportionate market advantage. The brands that don't will pay premium prices for commoditized AI solutions later.

The window for strategic AI positioning is closing fast.
