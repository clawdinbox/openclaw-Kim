**The Real AI Revolution in Fashion Isn't in the Design Studio**

While everyone's obsessing over AI-generated moodboards, Zara's parent company Inditex spent €2.5 billion on something more valuable: demand-sensing systems.

The results:
• 2.5M items processed daily by AI-driven logistics
• 20% reduction in overstock vs 2023
• €40M+ recovered margin at scale

Fashion destroys 30-40% of inventory annually. Design tools create more options. Demand sensing ensures the right options reach the right stores.

The consensus says AI democratizes design. The reality: AI concentrates advantage among brands with data infrastructure. The competitive moat is shifting from creative taste to predictive capability.

**What to watch:** Q4 earnings citing AI-driven forecasting as a margin driver.

The bottom line: AI in fashion isn't about creating more. It's about creating right.
