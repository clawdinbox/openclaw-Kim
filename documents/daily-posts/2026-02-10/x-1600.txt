Bjørn Gulden achieved Adidas' four-year turnaround plan in three years.

The numbers: 13% currency-neutral growth. €24.8B revenue. €2.06B operating profit.

While Nike bleeds jobs and Under Armour loses Steph Curry, Adidas is buying back $1.2B in stock.

Gulden's playbook isn't complicated: diverse portfolio, speed to market, knowing Adidas doesn't need to beat Nike in America to win globally.

The risk: price hikes from tariff offsets. The opportunity: World Cup this summer.

Right now? They're taking market share while everyone else defends theirs.
