Adidas just announced a $1.2 billion stock buyback.

This after posting 13% growth and €2.06B operating profit.

Context: Nike is cutting jobs. Under Armour stock dropped 40%. Puma is selling.

The sportswear sector isn't in decline. The leadership is just changing hands.

Who's actually executing right now? Name three brands. The third is harder than it should be.
