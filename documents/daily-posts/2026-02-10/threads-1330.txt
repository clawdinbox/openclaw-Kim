Q4 earnings season is wrapping up. One honest question:

Which brand in fashion/luxury/sportswear executed best this quarter?

Not who had the best marketing. Not who won on hype.

Who actually delivered — product, numbers, strategy?

I'll start: Adidas. 13% growth, turnaround completed in 3 years instead of 4, buying back stock while competitors cut jobs.

Who's your pick?
