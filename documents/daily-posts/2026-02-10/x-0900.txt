Bank of America says sportswear is "losing relative attractiveness."

Meanwhile:
→ Adidas posts 13% growth + $1.2B buyback
→ Nike cuts 775 jobs after 5 quarters of decline  
→ Under Armour down 40% and lost Steph Curry
→ Puma sales fell 10.4%, selling to Anta

One brand is executing. Three are defending.

The sector isn't losing attractiveness. The leaders are just changing.
