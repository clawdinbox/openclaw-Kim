# Substack Note — February 7, 2026

Zara's €2.5B secret isn't AI design tools.

It's demand sensing: systems that predict what sells before it hits stores.

Result: 20% less overstock. At €1B scale, that's €40M recovered.

Fashion's AI conversation is dominated by moodboards and generative prints. The real margin is in knowing what to make, not how to design it.

The gap between leaders and laggards isn't creativity. It's data infrastructure.

Which side is your brand on?
