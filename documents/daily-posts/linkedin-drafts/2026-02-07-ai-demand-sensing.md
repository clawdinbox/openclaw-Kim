## Topic: AI Demand Sensing vs Design Tools in Fashion

---

Everyone's obsessing over AI-generated moodboards.

Zara's parent company spent €2.5 billion on something completely different: demand-sensing systems that read real-time sell-through data and optimize allocation across 5,700+ stores.

Their logistics center processes 2.5 million items daily. AI decides where each item goes.

Result: 20% reduction in overstock compared to 2023 levels.

At a €1 billion brand, that's €40 million in recovered margin.

The design tools get the headlines. The demand prediction gets the money.

Here's what most brands miss: AI's competitive advantage isn't in creating more options. It's in knowing which options to create.

Zara's flywheel is data → insight → decision → action → more data. Each implementation makes the next one better.

The question for 2026: Are you investing in tools that expand creative search, or systems that compress decision risk?

One is nice to have. The other is survival.

What's your brand prioritizing?
