Hermès just raised prices again. The resale market barely flinched.

That is the difference between pricing power and price hikes.

One is earned. The other is borrowed time.

The luxury industry has a problem.

After years of raising prices with no bump in quality or creativity, shoppers are losing trust.

The BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2026 report says it clearly: brands must rebuild value.

But here is the question: Can they?

When you have trained customers to buy for status, not substance, how do you pivot?

Which luxury brands do you think will actually fix their value equation?

**Headline for image**: LUXURY'S VALUE CRISIS

**Caption**:
Luxury brands raised prices 40% in 4 years. Quality stayed flat.

Now the bill is coming due.

The BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2026 report is clear: after years of price hikes without corresponding value, shoppers are questioning the equation.

Hermès keeps raising prices. The resale market barely notices — because their value is real.

Other houses are not so lucky. Neiman Marcus is shrinking. Saks is restructuring. The wholesale middleman is dying.

The brands that will win in 2026 are the ones that rebuild trust — not just raise prices.

Value has to mean something again.

Which luxury brands still deliver real value to you?
