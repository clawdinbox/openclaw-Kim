AI won't replace fashion buyers. It'll replace the 40% of inventory they currently destroy.

Zara's €2.5B demand-sensing system moves 2.5M items daily.

Design tools get the hype. Demand prediction gets the margin.

Everyone's talking about AI design tools in fashion. But here's what actually moves the needle:

Zara's parent company spent €2.5 billion on systems that predict what sells before it hits stores. Their logistics center processes 2.5 million items daily — and AI decides where each one goes.

Result? 20-50% less inventory waste. At a €1B brand, that's €20-40M in recovered margin.

The design tools are nice. But predicting demand is everything.

What do you think — will AI forecasting become the real competitive advantage?

AI design tools are getting all the attention.

But the brands winning with AI are doing something completely different.

They're not using it to create better moodboards.

They're using it to know what will sell before they make it.

Zara's parent company Inditex spent €2.5 billion on demand-sensing systems that read real-time sell-through data and optimize allocation across 5,700+ stores.

Their logistics center processes 2.5 million items daily. AI decides where each item goes.

The result: 20-50% reduction in inventory waste. At a €1 billion brand, that's €20-40 million in recovered margin.

Fashion destroys 30-40% of inventory annually through markdowns and waste. AI-driven demand forecasting is changing that equation.

The design tools are nice. But predicting demand is everything.

Which side of AI is your brand investing in?
