TWEET 1 (Hook):
I spent 3 months analyzing how AI is reshaping fashion value chain. Most brands are focused on the wrong thing. Here is the reality of where AI actually creates leverage in fashion 👇

TWEET 2:
Everyone is obsessing over AI design tools.

Midjourney moodboards. Generative prints. Virtual samples.

Useful? Yes.

But the real competitive advantage is not in the design studio.

TWEET 3:
It is in the layer nobody talks about:

Demand sensing.

Zara parent company spent €2.5B on systems that read real-time sell-through data and optimize allocation across 5,700+ stores.

Their logistics center processes 2.5M items daily.

AI decides where each item goes.

TWEET 4:
Fashion destroys 30-40% of inventory annually through markdowns and waste.

AI-driven demand forecasting cuts this by 20-50%.

At a $1B brand, that is $20-40M in recovered margin.

Design tools are nice.

Predicting what sells is everything.

TWEET 5:
I mapped 5 shifts reshaping fashion in 2026:

1. Experimentation → Infrastructure
2. Solo designer → Human-AI collaboration  
3. Forecasting → Demand sensing
4. Content scarcity → Content abundance
5. Sustainability narrative → Measurable systems

TWEET 6:
The brands winning in 2026 have something in common:

They started the AI flywheel early.

Data → Insights → Decisions → Actions → More Data

Each implementation makes the next one better.

Compounding advantage.

TWEET 7:
Most brands do not need more AI pilots.

They need a strategic framework for:
- Which use cases to prioritize
- How to measure ROI
- How to build internal buy-in
- Where to start in the next 90 days

TWEET 8:
I built a 24-page Strategic Playbook covering:

→ AI across the full value chain
→ Competitive implications
→ The AI Flywheel framework
→ 90-day implementation roadmap

Not surface-level trends. Analyst-grade strategy.

TWEET 9:

• The 5 shifts every brand leader must understand
• The AI Flywheel framework
• A 90-day sprint plan
