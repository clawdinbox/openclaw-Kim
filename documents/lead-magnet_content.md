### Page 2 — The 5 Shifts (The Core Content)

**AI is no longer a "tool layer" for fashion. It's becoming a system layer.**

Here are the five shifts every brand leader needs to understand:

**1. From Experimentation to Infrastructure**
AI is moving from pilot projects to core operations. The brands winning in 2026 treat AI as infrastructure, not innovation theater.

**2. Design Becomes Collaborative**
The designer + AI workflow is replacing the solo designer. Speed of iteration matters more than perfection of first draft.

**3. Demand Sensing Beats Forecasting**
Traditional seasonal forecasting is dying. Real-time demand sensing through AI is the new standard for inventory and production decisions.

**4. Content Production Scales Infinitely**
Marketing teams can now produce 100x the creative assets with the same headcount. The constraint shifts from production capacity to strategic direction.

**5. Sustainability Becomes Measurable**
AI enables true traceability and impact measurement. Sustainability moves from narrative to verifiable system.

### Page 3 — The AI Flywheel for Fashion

[Visual framework showing the flywheel: Data → Insights → Decisions → Actions → More Data]

**The Flywheel Effect:**
Each AI implementation generates data that improves the next. Brands that start the flywheel first compound their advantage fastest.

**Where to Start:**
1. Pick one high-leverage use case (design, demand planning, or content)
2. Prove value in 90 days
3. Use success to fund expansion
