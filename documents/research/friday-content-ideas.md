## Topic 1: Kering's €29M Net Loss vs. The "Slow Turnaround" Narrative

**The Story:**
Kering just posted a net loss of €29 million for 2025 (vs. €1.02B profit in 2024), with revenue down 13% to €14.7B. Q4 revenue fell 9% as reported, 3% on a comparable basis.

**Contrarian Angle:**
The market is treating this as "better than expected" because it beat consensus estimates (analysts predicted -5% organic drop, actual was -3%). But the real story isn't the beat—it's that Luca de Meo's turnaround is showing *sequential improvement* despite the headline loss.

**Key Data Points:**
- Cost savings delivered: €925M in 2025 (operating expenses down 9%)
- 75 stores closed in 2025, another 100 planned for 2026
- Net debt reduced from €10.5B to €8.04B
- Saint Laurent: flat in Q4 (improvement from prior declines)
- Balenciaga + Alexander McQueen group: +3% organic growth in Q4
- Bottega Veneta: +3% organic growth in Q4

**The Narrative Flip:**
De Meo says: *"This revenue level reflects the low point of the cycle and the starting point of our rebound."* The Capital Markets Day on April 16 in Florence will be the real tell.

## Topic 2: Gucci's -19% Decline & The Demna Effect

**The Story:**
Gucci revenue dropped 22% as reported, 19% on a comparable basis in 2025—to €6B. Operating margin fell 4.9 points to 16.1%.

**Contrarian Angle:**
Everyone's focused on the decline, but Q4 showed "sequential improvement" with organic revenue down 10% (vs. -11% forecast). Demna's arrival is already reviving interest. The "La Famiglia" collection launched in September is driving newness.

**Key Data Points:**
- Gucci accounts for 59% of Kering's operating profit (down from peak but still dominant)
- Wholesale revenue down 34% (deliberate exclusivity strategy)
- Direct retail (92% of Gucci sales): down 18% comparable
- De Meo's weekend store visits: *"There is energy coming back. Our products are reconnecting with our clients."*

**The Question:**
Is Demna the right choice for Gucci? The early signals suggest the creative spark is returning, but can it translate to sales in 2026?

## Topic 3: Adidas vs. Nike: The Great Divergence

**The Story:**
Adidas just reported record revenue of €24.8 billion ($29.6B) for 2025, up 13% currency-neutral for the second consecutive year. Operating profit more than doubled to €2.06B. They're launching a $1.2B stock buyback.

Meanwhile, Nike is in crisis mode: -10% revenue decline in fiscal 2025, stock down 50%+ over 3 years, China revenue down 17% in Q2, direct-to-consumer sales down 8%.

**Contrarian Angle:**
Bank of America just double-downgraded Adidas from "buy" to "underperform" a few weeks ago, claiming the Samba bubble was bursting. The preliminary results proved them wrong. The contrarian take: Adidas's resilience isn't just about the Samba—it's about portfolio diversity and execution while Nike is still restructuring.

**Key Data Points:**
- Adidas: 13% growth in 2025, 13% in 2024 (consistent)
- Nike: First year-over-year revenue growth in 5 quarters in Dec 2025 (+1%)
- Nike just cut 775 more jobs (mostly distribution) to boost automation
- Under Armour stock slumped 40% in 2025
- Puma sold to Anta after declining revenue

**The Bigger Picture:**
Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden: *"We are lucky to be in an industry that sells consumer products for many segments... We are very confident that all these segments will continue to grow."*

## Topic 4: The Luxury Recovery That Isn't (Yet)

**The Story:**
HSBC anticipates 2.6% increase in global luxury sales in Q4 2025, after 3.2% in Q3. But LVMH just disappointed with operating profit down to €17.15B from €19.57B in 2024. The Pinault family sold its Puma stake to Anta.

**Contrarian Angle:**
Analysts are calling Q4 2025 "the first proof point" of recovery, but the data is mixed. The real story: luxury is bifurcating. Hermès and Richemont (jewelry) are steady. LVMH is struggling. Kering is restructuring. The "recovery" is sector-specific, not industry-wide.

**Key Data Points:**
- LVMH Fashion & Leather Goods: -3% organic in Q4 (in line with consensus)
- Global luxury market 2025: $382.20 billion projected
- China: stabilization despite real estate weakness, youth unemployment
- US: post-election shopping frenzy makes Q4 2024 comps difficult
- Europe & Southeast Asia: weak spots (low tourist spend)
- Japan: China-Japan tensions over Taiwan weighing on Chinese tourists

**The Strategic Shift:**
Brands are pivoting from "aspirational tourists" to "local consumers." Currency fluctuations make overseas shopping less attractive.

## Topic 5: AI in Fashion: From Hype to Actual ROI

**The Story:**
2025 is the year AI moved from fashion tech buzzword to measurable business impact. Virtual try-ons are cutting return rates by up to 40% and boosting conversions by 25%.

**Contrarian Angle:**
Everyone talks about AI design tools, but the real money is in logistics, inventory management, and virtual sampling. Digital fashion is reducing waste by eliminating physical samples. The sustainability angle is the sleeper story.

**Key Data Points:**
- Style3D: Virtual try-ons cut returns up to 40%, boost conversions 25%
- FitRoom (launched Feb 2025): #1 app in Vietnam's App Store, 10-15 sec generation times
- SpreeAI: Raised Series B in 2025 (led by Davidson Group)
- Perfect Corp: Partnering with Nicole Miller for generative AI try-ons
- Applications: predictive trend forecasting, personalized recommendations, automated pattern-making, 3D knitting

**The Narrative:**
AI isn't replacing designers—it's eliminating waste in the supply chain. The brands winning are those using AI for operational efficiency, not just marketing stunts.

## Topic 6: The Casualization Era Is Ending (And Nobody's Ready)

**The Story:**
BoF's warning on Adidas flagged a deeper question: Is fashion's "casualization era" ending? Sneakers and streetwear dominated the 2010s-early 2020s. But luxury is quietly pivoting back to formality and occasion-wear.

**Contrarian Angle:**
The data doesn't support a full return to formal—yet. But the *growth* is shifting. Adidas's success with retro styles (Samba, Gazelle) suggests nostalgia cycles are shortening. Meanwhile, luxury is re-emphasizing craftsmanship and timelessness over hype.

**Key Evidence:**
- Adidas Samba/Gazelle driving double-digit growth in Q3 2024
- Kering's Demna appointment signals return to avant-garde fashion (not streetwear)
- LVMH focusing on "aspirational" luxury shoppers (more accessible entry points)
- Nike's struggle: too dependent on performance wear, missing lifestyle shift

**The Prediction:**
2026 will see a divergence—athleisure becomes commoditized (Adidas, H&M, Zara), while luxury doubles down on exclusivity and craftsmanship. The middle market gets squeezed.

## Topic 7: The China Question: Losing a Generation of Luxury Shoppers

**The Story:**
China's luxury market is "stabilizing" but youth unemployment and real estate weakness are creating a lost generation of aspirational shoppers. Nike's China revenue dropped 17% in Q2; Lululemon is growing exponentially in the same market.

**Contrarian Angle:**
It's not that Chinese consumers stopped spending—it's that they're spending differently. Domestic Chinese brands are winning. The "revenge spending" post-COVID is over. The new Chinese luxury consumer is older, wealthier, and more discriminating.

**Key Data Points:**
- Nike Greater China: -17% YoY in fiscal Q2 (vs. -9% in Q1)
- Lululemon: Exceptional growth in China (same period)
- Chinese tourists not returning to Europe in pre-pandemic numbers
- Currency: Strong euro makes European shopping expensive for Chinese consumers
- Kering/LVMH focusing on "local consumers" not tourists

**The Strategic Implication:**
Luxury brands that built their 2010s growth on Chinese tourism and aspirational middle-class shoppers need a new playbook. The ones adapting fastest (Hermès, local Chinese luxury brands) are winning.

## Summary: Key Themes for Friday Content

1. **The Kering Turnaround** - Sequential improvement matters more than headline losses
2. **Adidas vs. Nike** - One thriving, one restructuring; the divergence tells a bigger story
3. **AI in Fashion** - Beyond the hype: real ROI in returns reduction and sustainability
4. **Luxury's False Recovery** - Sector bifurcation, not industry-wide rebound
5. **The China Reset** - A generation of shoppers has moved on; brands must adapt

**Recommended Angle:** Focus on data-backed contrarian takes. The consensus narrative ("luxury is recovering") is fragile. The real stories are in the divergence between winners and losers.
