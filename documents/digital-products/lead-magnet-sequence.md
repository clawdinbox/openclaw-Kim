Subject: Your AI Fashion Framework (quick wins inside)

Hi there,

Thanks for downloading The AI Fashion Framework.

Your 5-page Quick-Start Guide is attached. Before you dive in, 
here's how to get the most from it:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**START HERE → The 90-Day Sprint Plan**

Flip to Page 4. Even if you only have 15 minutes, this gives you 
a concrete starting point.

Most brands skip this step and jump straight to tool shopping.
Don't be most brands.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Over the next few days, I'll send you:**

→ A breakdown of the AI Flywheel (and why it matters for your brand)
→ The #1 mistake brands make when starting AI pilots
→ How to build internal buy-in without a massive budget

These are the same frameworks I use when advising fashion & 
luxury brands on AI strategy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Questions? Hit reply.** I read every message.

If you're on LinkedIn, connect with me there too:

Talk soon,
Marcel

P.S. — Save this email. The PDF downloads sometimes get buried 
in inboxes.

## EMAIL 2: DEEP DIVE — THE AI FLYWHEEL
**Trigger:** Day 2 (24 hours after welcome)
**Subject:** The compounding advantage most brands miss
**Goal:** Deliver core concept, build trust, demonstrate expertise

Subject: The compounding advantage most brands miss

Hi again,

Yesterday you got the 90-Day Sprint Plan. Today, let's talk about 
*where that plan leads* — if you execute it right.

There's a concept I share with every brand I advise:

**The AI Flywheel for Fashion**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Here's how it works:**

Each AI implementation generates data → which produces better 
insights → which enables smarter decisions → which create more 
effective actions → which generate even more data.

The brands that start this flywheel first compound their advantage 
fastest.

The brands that wait? They don't just lose time. They lose the 
*data advantage* that makes later implementations 10x more effective.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Real example:**

A sportswear brand I tracked started with AI-powered demand sensing 
in 2022. By 2024, their inventory accuracy hit 94%. Their competitor? 
Started piloting the same tools in 2024, but without the historical 
data...their accuracy ceiling is 78%.

That gap? It's widening every quarter.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your takeaway:**

The 90-Day Sprint isn't just about launching a pilot. It's about 
*starting the flywheel.*

Even a small, focused pilot generates the data that makes your 
second implementation better, faster, cheaper.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tomorrow: The #1 mistake brands make (and how to avoid it).

— Marcel

P.S. — If you want the complete AI Flywheel framework plus 
implementation playbooks across the entire value chain, it's in 
the full Strategic Playbook: https://gumroad.com/l/[PLAYBOOK-LINK]

## EMAIL 3: PROBLEM AGITATION — THE #1 MISTAKE
**Trigger:** Day 4 (48 hours after Email 2)
**Subject:** The AI pilot graveyard (avoid this)
**Goal:** Agitate pain point, position as solution, pre-frame offer

**OPEN RATE TARGET:** 50%+
**CLICK RATE TARGET:** 20%+

```
Subject: The AI pilot graveyard (avoid this)

Hi,

Let's talk about the AI pilot graveyard.

It's crowded.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**The #1 mistake:**

Brands treat AI pilots as "innovation theater" instead of 
"strategic infrastructure."

They launch a design AI tool for one season. Run a demand 
forecasting test on one product line. Spin up a content AI 
for one campaign.

Then? The pilot ends. No scale. No integration. No flywheel.

**Three years later:** Someone new proposes "exploring AI." 
The cycle repeats. Budget drains. Zero compounding advantage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Why this happens:**

Most brands lack the frameworks to:
• Identify which use cases actually matter for *their* strategy
• Structure governance across siloed teams
• Build the business case for Phase 2 funding
• Measure ROI in ways the C-suite understands

So pilots launch without a path to production. They succeed 
in isolation but die at scale.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**The alternative:**

Start with strategy. Not tools.

The 5-page framework you downloaded gives you a foundation. 
But going deep requires a more comprehensive approach.

The full Strategic Playbook (24 pages) includes:
→ The Phase-Gated Implementation Strategy
→ Use-Case Portfolio Analysis framework
→ KPI Trees for different stakeholder audiences
→ Governance models that actually work

Basically: Everything you need to move from pilot to production.

I'll share more tomorrow.

## EMAIL 4: BRIDGE — BUILDING BUY-IN
**Trigger:** Day 6 (48 hours after Email 3)
**Subject:** How to pitch AI without a 7-figure budget
**Goal:** Address objection (budget), deliver practical value, soft intro to offer

**OPEN RATE TARGET:** 48%+
**CLICK RATE TARGET:** 22%+

```
Subject: How to pitch AI without a 7-figure budget

Quick question:

What's the hardest part of launching AI at your brand?

If you said "getting budget approved," you're not alone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Here's the thing:**

Most budget requests fail because they sound like:
"We should explore AI tools to stay competitive."

Winning requests sound like:
"We can reduce inventory carrying costs by 12% with a 90-day 
pilot costing €50K. Here's the phased rollout plan and the 
KPIs we track."

See the difference?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**The internal sell requires:**

1. **Specific use case** (not "AI") — e.g., "demand sensing for 
   Spring/Summer collection"
2. **90-day pilot plan** — bounded, measurable, low-risk
3. **Pre-built KPI framework** — before they ask "how do we 
   measure this?"
4. **Phase-gated expansion** — only grow if Phase 1 hits targets
5. **Governance model** — who decides what, when

Give the decision-makers a *decision framework*, not a wish.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Real talk:**

This is exactly why I built the full Strategic Playbook.

The 5-page Quick-Start Guide you have is genuinely useful. 
But the full Playbook includes board-ready structures:

• KPI Trees adapted for different stakeholders (CFO vs. 
  Creative Director vs. COO)
• Business case templates
• Governance frameworks for cross-functional teams
• Risk assessment matrices

Basically: Everything I use when advising brands on AI strategy.

For €19, you get the frameworks that help you land budget 
for pilots 10x that size.

More on this tomorrow.

Subject: The full framework is ready (if you want it)

Hi,

Over the past week, I've shared:

→ The 90-Day Sprint Plan
→ The AI Flywheel framework
→ Why most AI pilots fail (and how to avoid it)
→ How to build internal buy-in with limited budget

These frameworks come from the work I do advising fashion & 
luxury brands on AI strategy.

**If you've found them useful, there's more.**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**The AI Fashion Strategic Playbook**

24 pages. Analyst-grade. Built for decision-makers.

**What's inside beyond the Quick-Start Guide:**

✓ Complete value chain analysis across 6 functions
  (design, sourcing, manufacturing, merchandising, marketing, 
   commerce, resale)

✓ The Phase-Gated AI Implementation Strategy
  (from audit → pilot → scale without boiling the ocean)

✓ Strategic Market Implications
  (moats, assets, winners, losers — and where your brand fits)

✓ Use-Case Portfolio Analysis
  (prioritize ruthlessly with this framework)

✓ AI Flywheel deep-dive
  (how advantage compounds, with specific examples)

✓ KPI Trees & Governance Models
  (measure what matters, structure for scale)

✓ 90-Day Sprint Plan (expanded)
  (detailed week-by-week breakdown)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Who it's for:**

Brand executives making AI investment decisions. Strategy 
leads building roadmaps. Founders who need clarity before 
their next hire or tool purchase.

**Who it's not for:**

Anyone looking for a list of AI tools to try. This is a 
*strategy* playbook, not a vendor catalog.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Investment:**

€19. Price of a lunch. For frameworks you'd normally pay 
thousands in consulting fees to access.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Still not sure?**

That's fair. The 5-page Quick-Start Guide you already have 
is genuinely useful — and it stays useful.

But if you:
• Need to present AI strategy to a board or leadership team
• Are responsible for building an AI roadmap
• Want to avoid the "pilot purgatory" trap
• Need to justify AI investments with structured frameworks

...the full playbook is built for you.

No pressure either way.

P.S. — Every buyer gets direct access. Hit reply with questions 
after purchase — I read every message and usually respond within 
a day.
