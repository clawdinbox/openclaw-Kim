# Day Zero — System Setup

Today marks the beginning of the Kim + Marcel operating system.

## What Happened

- **Identity established:** Kim 🦞 — AI operator, not assistant
- **Operating principle defined:** Make Marcel faster, clearer, and harder to outcompete
- **Security baseline:** macOS hardened, FileVault on, OpenClaw permissions tightened

## Systems Deployed

Four automated systems now running:

1. **Morning Brief (08:00)** — Weather, YouTube trends, tasks, stories, productivity recs
2. **Afternoon Report (14:00)** — Deep-dive research on relevant topics
3. **Proactive Coder (23:00)** — Build tools, create PRs, improve workflows
4. **2nd Brain** — This document viewer + auto-generated knowledge base

## Key Decisions

- Todo list lives in Apple Notes
- Weather location: Düsseldorf
- Interests: Fashion, luxury, sportswear, resale, culture, AI/ML, business strategy
- GitHub repo for PRs: TBD

## Next Steps

- Get GitHub repo path from Marcel
- First afternoon report fires at 14:00 today
- First proactive coder session at 23:00 tonight
- Morning brief starts tomorrow at 08:00
