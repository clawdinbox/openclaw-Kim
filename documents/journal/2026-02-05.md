## 2026-02-05 — Work Log (Kim → Marcel)

### Ebook: AI’s Impact on Fashion
- Produced a *strategy-grade* draft for:
  - Executive Brief (1 page)
  - Section V: Actionable Opportunities (phase-gated roadmap + flywheel + use-case portfolio + KPIs + governance + 90-day sprint plan)
  - Conclusion
- File: `documents/ai-impact-on-fashion_ebook_draft.md`

### Next (to finish “spectacular”)
- Add: 6–10 short caselets (brands / platforms / functions) with 1 insight each
- Add: 2–3 simple visuals (flywheel, phased roadmap, KPI tree)
- Tight edit for voice + remove repetition
- Convert to PDF + clean layout (title page, TOC, callouts)

### Marcel review questions (fast)
1) Target audience: brand CEO/CMO/COO or innovation lead?
2) Preferred length: 10–15 pages or 25–35 pages?
3) Any must-include topics: resale/circular, supply chain, creative tooling, EU AI regulation?
