# LVMH's China numbers just changed the narrative for 2026

Something shifted in January. After 18 months of cautious guidance, luxury's bellwether is flashing green.

LVMH reported Q4 earnings: +18% growth in China. That's not seasonal — that's structural recovery.

**The Data:**
• China Q4: +18% (vs +5% in Q3)
• Overall revenue: €23.4B (+9% YoY)
• Operating margin expanded 40bps to 22.3%

**The Context:**
Bernard Arnault went from warning of "fluctuating demand" in October to describing "strong momentum" in January. Policy stimulus is landing. The wealth effect is back. Inventory is normalizing.

**The Implication:**
The bifurcation theme is intensifying. Ultra-luxury never left. Now the aspirational buyer is returning. The middle? Still squeezed.

Brands with clear tiering strategies will capture both. Those stuck in the middle will struggle.

**The question for you:** Are you seeing this recovery in your segment, or is the bifurcation making it harder to read the market? Drop a comment — curious how this is playing out across different categories.
