The duopoly is under siege.

Anta Sports just acquired a 29% stake in Puma for $1.8 billion. China's third-largest sportswear company now controls three global brands: Anta (value), Fila (premium lifestyle), and Puma (performance).

For decades, Nike and Adidas traded blows while everyone else fought for scraps. That equilibrium is now fragile.

Anta isn't buying Puma for diversification. They're buying distribution networks across 120+ countries, brand equity in Western markets, and manufacturing expertise that would take a decade to build.

This is vertical integration at industrial scale—with a state-adjacent player executing a sovereign strategy through private capital.

**The implications extend beyond balance sheets:**

When Beijing favors domestic champions—or the next supply chain shock hits—Nike and Adidas face an opponent that doesn't care about their margins or quarterly timelines.

Three brands. Three price tiers. Global reach.

The sportswear wars have a new superpower.

**What's your take?** Will Anta's Puma stake reshape the competitive landscape, or is this an overreach?
