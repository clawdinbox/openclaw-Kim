## Opening: The Big Picture

Something shifted in January. After 18 months of cautious guidance and muted forecasts, luxury's bellwether is flashing green. LVMH's Q4 results aren't just numbers — they're a signal that the China recovery is accelerating faster than even the optimists predicted.

---

## The Signal: China's Comeback Is Real

### Context

LVMH reported Q4 2025 earnings on January 28, and the numbers tell a clear story:

- **Revenue**: €23.4B (+9% YoY, +12% organic)
- **Operating Margin**: 22.3% (up 40bps)
- **China Recovery**: +18% vs. Q3's +5%
- **US Performance**: +7% (premium consumer resilient)
- **Source**: LVMH Q4 2025 Earnings Call, January 28, 2026

The standout: Asia (ex-Japan) accelerated from +5% in Q3 to +18% in Q4. That's not seasonal. That's structural recovery.

### Analysis: So What?

Bernard Arnault has been cautious on China for two years. In Q3, he warned of "fluctuating" demand and consumer uncertainty. Three months later, he's describing "strong momentum" and "reassuring trends."

What changed?

**Policy stimulus is landing.** China's November consumer support measures are finally translating into luxury spend. The government's focus on domestic consumption isn't abstract — it's showing up in boutique traffic.

**Wealth effect is back.** Chinese equity markets rallied 15% in Q4. High-net-worth consumers feel richer, and they're spending like it.

**Inventory normalization.** After two years of destocking, wholesale partners are reordering. This isn't just sell-through improving — it's new orders flowing.

### The Ripple Effect

If LVMH is seeing this, everyone else will follow. Hermès and Kering report in February. Richemont next. Expect similar China beats across the sector.

But the bigger implication: the bifurcation theme everyone's been talking about? It's intensifying. The ultra-luxury consumer (Hermès, Chanel, top-tier Vuitton) never left. Now the aspirational buyer is returning. The middle? Still squeezed.

Brands with clear tiering strategies will capture both. Those stuck in the middle will struggle.

## What We're Watching

### 1. Hermès Q4 (Feb 14)

The ultimate stress-test. If Hermès is seeing China acceleration, the recovery is universal. If they're muted, it confirms LVMH's brand strength narrative. Either way, it moves markets.

### 2. Kering's New Structure

François-Henri Pinault reorganized into "Luxury" and "Lifestyle" divisions. First results under this structure will show if it's operational reality or PowerPoint shuffling. Watch Gucci's China numbers closely.

### 3. Milan Fashion Week (Feb 24-Mar 2)

First major runway season of 2026. With China recovery underway, expect more investment in show production, celebrity placement, and digital activation. Brands are spending again.

## Closing: One Insight

The luxury recovery isn't uniform — it's bifurcated. The ultra-high-net-worth consumer never left, but the aspirational buyer is still cautious. Brands that recognize this and adjust their portfolio mix will win 2026. Those that don't will wonder why their promotions aren't working.

**Thanks for reading.**

If you found this valuable, forward it to a colleague. If you have a different take, hit reply — I read every response.
