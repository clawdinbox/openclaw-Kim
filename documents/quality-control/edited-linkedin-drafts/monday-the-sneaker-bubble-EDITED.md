# The Sneaker Bubble Has Popped — And That's Good for Business

Only 47% of new sneaker releases are profitable on resale markets in 2025. Three years ago, that number was 82%.

StockX and GOAT built empires on hype-fueled scarcity markets. But the data tells a different story now. ASICS running silhouettes are up 45% YoY on resale platforms (per StockX 2025 category analysis) while Jordan 1s sit at retail. The "runner aesthetic" is eating the "hypebeast" lunch.

What's really happening? Market maturation. Transparent pricing killed the arbitrage game. Restocks have become perpetual. And Gen Z — who make up 32% of resale purchases — aren't collecting. They're wearing.

Look at Lululemon: 14.6% sales growth forecast vs. Nike's 3%. The premium performance segment is winning while retro collaborations struggle. Even Anta is planning 25-30% growth in China by expanding to 151+ stores.

The sneaker market isn't dying. It's bifurcating. Speculators are bleeding. Wearers are winning. Brands that focused on product (ASICS, On Running, Hoka) are outperforming brands that focused on drops.

If your strategy still hinges on limited releases creating artificial scarcity, you're playing the wrong game. The new luxury is function over flex.
