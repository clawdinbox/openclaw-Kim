# Why Sportswear Stocks Tanked 14% — And Why Lululemon Isn't Worried

85 public sporting goods companies lost 14.3% market cap year-to-date in 2025. Nike, Adidas, and Lululemon led the decline. But one of these is not like the others.

The divergence is stark. Lululemon's growth forecast: 14.6%. Nike's: 3%. Adidas sits at 10% global sportswear market share but shrinking margins. Anta (11% share) is eating China's lunch with 25-30% revenue growth planned.

What separates winners from losers? DTC focus and category expansion. Lululemon grew beyond yoga into connected fitness (Mirror acquisition) and menswear. Nike talked DTC for years but still relies heavily on wholesale. Adidas is betting on sustainability ("Strung" textile tech, 2025 targets) — noble, but is it moving revenue?

The premium positioning is holding. ASICS running category up 45% YoY. On Running and Hoka continue stealing share from legacy players. The market is fragmenting, not consolidating.

2025 sportswear isn't about footwear dominance. It's about ecosystem lock-in. Brands building communities (Lululemon's studio membership, Nike's apps) will outperform brands selling products.

If you measure success by sell-through at Foot Locker, you're already behind. The next battleground isn't retail shelf space — it's recurring revenue and authenticated community access.
