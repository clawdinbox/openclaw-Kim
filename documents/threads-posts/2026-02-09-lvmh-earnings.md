LVMH just beat earnings expectations.

Stock still dropped 8%.

Bernard Arnault's response: "We're not mesmerized by the quarter."

The luxury sector is recalibrating. The brands that resist discounting through this trough will emerge structurally stronger.

The question isn't when demand snaps back.

It's who has the discipline to wait.
