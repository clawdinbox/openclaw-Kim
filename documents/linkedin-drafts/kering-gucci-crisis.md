Gucci keeps sliding and Kering has just warned of more pain ahead, reinforcing that this is no short-term blip but a prolonged challenge. The message is clear: turning around Gucci is a marathon, not a sprint.

The problem isn't cyclical; it's structural. At its core, Gucci has lost its cultural relevance. Once the arbiter of cool, it’s struggling to resonate with the contemporary zeitgeist, a critical misstep for any luxury brand. This isn't a matter of inventory or pricing, but a fundamental disconnect from what drives desire today.

In the cutthroat world of luxury, brand heat is the ultimate currency. Restructuring PowerPoints and new division charts do little to rekindle creativity or excitement when the brand's narrative has faded. Operational fixes cannot mend a deficit in cultural relevance and desirability.

Meanwhile, competitors are demonstrating resilience. LVMH navigates market shifts with extraordinary agility across its vast portfolio, and Hermès continues its ascent, proving the enduring power of heritage, quality, and consistent brand vision. These successes starkly highlight what Kering and Gucci are missing.

Kering's new "Luxury" and "Lifestyle" division structure is meant to signal a strategic shift. However, the real test of whether this is an operational reality or mere deck theater will come with the first results under this new framework, expected on February 14.
