# Gen Z Is Rewriting Luxury — And LVMH Should Be Nervous

**Hook:** Millennials and Gen Z will account for 75% of global luxury spending by end of 2025. But they're not buying what previous generations wanted.

**Body:** Vestiaire Collective and The RealReal aren't niche anymore. Gen Z's closets are 32% resale items — the highest of any generation. They'll pay $2,400 for a vintage Prada bag but scoff at full retail for new Gucci.

This isn't about saving money. It's about values collision. Gen Z sees luxury differently: heritage > hype, craft > logo, story > status. When Tiffany partnered with Nike and Supreme, it wasn't desperation — it was demographic triangulation. The collaboration playbook that worked for Rimowa (LV, Supreme, Off-White) is now standard ops.

But here's the kicker: Gen Z buys secondhand because they believe vintage quality exceeds current production. That's an existential threat to luxury's annual refresh cycle.

**Take:** The luxury slowdown isn't cyclical. It's structural. Brands optimized for Chinese consumption and logo-mania are facing a two-front war: Gen Z's value shift and China's uneven recovery.

**Close:** Your next flagship store shouldn't be on Fifth Avenue. It should be a verification and storytelling engine for the secondary market you're about to enter whether you like it or not.
