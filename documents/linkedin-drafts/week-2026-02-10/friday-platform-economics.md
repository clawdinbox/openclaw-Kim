# TikTok Shop Just Entered Luxury Resale. The Implications Are Massive.

**Hook:** 32% of Gen Z closets are resale items. Now TikTok Shop — 150M US users, 88 minutes daily average — is entering the authenticated luxury game.

**Body:** Vestiaire Collective IPO ambitions for 2025. The RealReal's public market struggles. StockX and GOAT professionalizing authentication. And now TikTok wants in.

The landscape shift is tectonic. Luxury resale was a Western phenomenon with boutique logistics. TikTok Shop brings algorithmic distribution at China-scale efficiency. When Douyin (TikTok's Chinese parent) already handles luxury with ease, the playbook exists.

For brands, this is a nightmare and opportunity. Nightmare: uncontrolled pricing, authentication disputes, brand dilution. Opportunity: access to Gen Z where they actually spend time — not on brand.com, not at Saks, but in-feed.

The counterintuitive truth: secondary market accessibility increases primary market demand. Porsche learned this. Rolex is learning it. Luxury fashion is next.

**Take:** The brands that survive won't fight resale. They'll architect it — controlled release of authenticated pre-owned through preferred partners, with revenue share.

**Close:** Your 2025 channel strategy needs a "resale" line item. Not as an afterthought. As a primary growth pillar. The platforms are coming whether you invite them or not.
