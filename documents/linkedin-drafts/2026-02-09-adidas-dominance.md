# LinkedIn Draft — Adidas' Quiet Dominance

**Hook:**
Bank of America downgraded Adidas to "underperform" last month. The stock barely flinched. Last week, Adidas announced record numbers — and a $1.2 billion buyback.

**Body:**
The sportswear narrative has been wrong.

Everyone declared Adidas peaked with the Samba. That its "moment" was ending. That the casualization trend was done.

The numbers tell a different story.

Adidas just posted 13% currency-neutral growth for the second straight year. Revenue hit €24.8 billion. Operating profit: €2.06 billion. CEO Bjørn Gulden achieved his four-year turnaround plan in three.

Meanwhile, the competition is bleeding.

Nike just cut 775 more jobs after five quarters of decline. Under Armour's stock dropped 40% last year — and lost Steph Curry. Puma sales fell 10.4% and the Pinault family is selling to Anta.

The industry is in chaos. Adidas is buying back stock.

**Take:**
Gulden's playbook isn't complicated: diverse product portfolio, speed to market, and knowing Adidas doesn't need to beat Nike in America to win globally.

The risk? Adidas raised prices in late 2025 to offset tariffs. Consumer tolerance isn't infinite. And they still need the next Samba before that well runs dry — possibly the World Cup this summer.

But right now? They're taking market share while everyone else defends theirs.

**Close:**
Who's actually executing in sportswear right now? Name three brands. The third one is harder than it should be.
