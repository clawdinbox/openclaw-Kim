### Threads Post 1 — Eddie Bauer/ABG
Eddie Bauer filed Chapter 11 for the third time.

Authentic Brands Group licensed the brand, then shifted to Outdoor 5 LLC just before filing.

The ABG model: extract brand value without operational investment. When the brand equity fades, there's nothing left to cushion the fall.

For resale/circular economy: outdoor heritage brands are vulnerable inventory plays. The brand story ≠ financial stability.

What's your take on licensing-heavy brand models?

### Threads Post 2 — Italian Textile Consolidation
Achille Pinto (Pierre-Louis Mascia parent) just acquired Canepa Silk's assets.

Third rescue attempt for the Como-based silk maker.

Pattern: vertically integrated players (LVMH, Hermès, Achille Pinto) picking off distressed Italian suppliers. Supply chain control becoming the moat.

"Made in Italy" increasingly means "owned by luxury groups."

How does this shift sourcing strategies for mid-tier brands?

### Threads Post 3 — Warby Parker AI Glasses
Warby Parker hired ex-Macy's COO Adrian Mitchell as CFO.

Explicit goal: launch AI-powered smart glasses with Google in 2026.

This is the first credible fashion-tech convergence at product level—not marketing. Mitchell's retail ops + Google's AI stack = threat to Luxottica's dominance.

Fashion eyewear is about to get interesting.

Who's watching this space?

### Threads Post 4 — Sportswear Report
The sportswear hierarchy is rewriting itself—and most coverage misses the signal.

I just published a 21-page analyst report on Nike, Adidas, Anta, Puma, Under Armour & Lululemon.

→ Adidas: post-Yeezy recovery with €1B buyback
→ Nike: turnaround under pressure
→ Anta: €1.5B Puma acquisition
→ Lululemon: -57% YTD

Same industry. Six different trajectories.

### Threads Post 5 — AI Fashion Framework
Most AI fashion discussions focus on tools.

The gap is frameworks—how do you actually integrate AI into strategy, not just operations?

I built a 5-page Quick-Start Guide covering the 5 structural shifts reshaping fashion in 2026:

→ From experimentation to infrastructure
→ From solo designer to human-AI collaboration
→ From forecasting to demand sensing

Free download. Frameworks you can use immediately.
