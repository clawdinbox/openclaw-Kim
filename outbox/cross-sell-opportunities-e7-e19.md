Hi [First Name],

By now you've had a chance to dig into the Sportswear Report.

One question I keep getting:

"The analysis is great — but how do I APPLY this to my brand?"

That's exactly why I built Fashion Brand Clarity.

━━

FASHION BRAND CLARITY (€7)

What it is:
A positioning framework + fill-in-the-blank template that turns 
market intelligence into brand decisions.

What's inside:
✓ The 5-question positioning audit
✓ Competitive differentiation matrix (template)
✓ Brand messaging framework
✓ Visual identity decision tree
✓ "Before/After" case studies

Who it's for:
Brand managers, founders, strategists who need to move from 
"interesting insight" → "actual decision."

The price:
€7. Less than a lunch. Way less than a consulting hour.

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up to the Sportswear Report.

One trend I didn't have room to explore in depth:
AI's impact on fashion operations, design, and strategy.

It's happening faster than most brands are prepared for.

━━

AI IMPACT ON FASHION (€19)

What it covers:
• Where AI is replacing vs. augmenting fashion jobs
• The brands using AI for competitive advantage (case studies)
• The AI stack for fashion operations (tools, costs, ROI)
• Strategic implications: what changes in 12-24 months
• Risk framework: what NOT to automate

Why €19?
This isn't a trend report. It's an implementation guide.
You get frameworks, vendor evaluations, and decision criteria.

━━
