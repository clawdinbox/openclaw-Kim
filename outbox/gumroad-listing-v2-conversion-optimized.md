### **FULL DESCRIPTION**

## The Sportswear War Just Escalated

**3 months. 6 giants. 1 seismic shift.**

While you were reading about sneaker drops, the competitive landscape was rewriting itself:

→ **Adidas** posted +13% growth and announced a **€1B buyback** — the post-Yeezy recovery nobody predicted  
→ **Nike** is bleeding market share in a "Win Now" turnaround that investors are starting to doubt  
→ **Anta** just spent **€1.5B on Puma** — the biggest M&A move since Adidas bought Reebok (2005)  
→ **Lululemon** cratered 57% YTD under assault from Alo Yoga, On, and Hoka  
→ **Under Armour** shows stabilization signs after losing Steph Curry to his own brand  
→ **Puma** is restructuring as Chinese ownership takes control

**Same industry. Six diverging fates. One question:** Who's actually positioned to win 2026?
