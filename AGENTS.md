# AGENTS.md - Workspace Guide

## First Run
If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, then delete it.

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for recent context
4. **Main session only:** Read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory
- Daily: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create folder if needed)
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md` (curated, main session only)
- **Rule:** Text > Brain. Write it down.

## Safety
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Ask before destructive commands
- `trash` > `rm`

## External vs Internal
- **Free:** Read, explore, organize, web search
- **Ask first:** Emails, posts, anything leaving machine

## Heartbeats
Read HEARTBEAT.md. Batch checks, be concise, respect quiet hours.

## Group Chats
See skills/group-chat-etiquette/SKILL.md

## Make It Yours
Add your own conventions as you learn.
